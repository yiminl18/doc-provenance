SUMMARY: This final rule implements\nthe administrative wage garnishment\nprovisions contained in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996\n(DCIA).Wage garnishment is a process\nwhereby an employer withholds\namounts from an employee’s wages and\npays those amounts to the employee’s\ncreditor in satisfaction of a withholding\norder.The DCIA authorizes Federal\nagencies administratively to garnish the\ndisposable pay of an individual to\ncollect delinquent nontax debts owed to\nthe United States in accordance with\nregulations issued by the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.DATES: This rule is effective June 5,\n1998.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nGerry Isenberg, Financial Program\nSpecialist, Debt Management Services,\nat (202) 874–6660 or James Regan,\nAttorney-Advisor, at (202) 874–6680,\nFinancial Management Service,\nDepartment of the Treasury, 401 14th\nStreet SW, Washington, DC 20227.This\ndocument is available for downloading\nfrom the Financial Management Service\nweb site at the following address: http:/\n/www.fms.treas.gov.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\nThis final rule implements the wage\n\ngarnishment provision in section\n31001(o) of the Debt Collection\nImprovement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Pub.L. 104–134, 110 Stat. 1321–358 (Apr.26,\n1996), codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D.Wage garnishment is a process whereby\nan employer withholds amounts from\nan employee’s wages and pays those\namounts to the employee’s creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.The\nDCIA authorizes Federal agencies\nadministratively to garnish up to 15% of\nthe disposable pay of a debtor to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.Prior to the enactment of\nthe DCIA, agencies were required to\nobtain a court judgment before\ngarnishing the wages of non-Federal\nemployees.Section 31001(o) of the\nDCIA preempts State laws that prohibit\nwage garnishment or otherwise govern\nwage garnishment procedures.As authorized by the DCIA, a Federal\n\nagency collecting delinquent nontax\ndebt may garnish administratively a\ndelinquent debtor’s wages in accordance\nwith regulations promulgated by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The Financial\nManagement Service (FMS), a bureau of\nthe Department of the Treasury, is\nresponsible for promulgating the\nregulations implementing this and other\ndebt collection tools established by the\nDCIA.In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.2. Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.For hearing requests\nthat are not received in the specified\ntime frame, an agency need not delay\nissuance of the withholding order prior\nto conducting a hearing.An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.The debtor bears the\nburden of informing the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. 3.Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.The DCIA prohibits employers from\ntaking disciplinary actions against the\ndebtor based on the fact that the debtor’s\nwages are subject to administrative\ngarnishment.In addition, the DCIA\n\nauthorizes an agency to sue an employer\nfor amounts not properly withheld from\nthe wages payable to the debtor.Discussion of Comments\n\nGeneral\n\nIn response to its Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking (NPRM) concerning\nAdministrative Wage Garnishment (62\nFR 62458, Nov. 21, 1997), FMS received\ncomments from Federal agencies,\nprivate collection agencies, an umbrella\norganization for organizations that\nsupport the activities of the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Programs, and a\nprivate citizen.Many of the commenters\nhave been involved in implementing a\nsimilar administrative wage\ngarnishment provision that authorizes\nthe U.S. Department of Education\n(Education) to garnish 10% of the\ndisposable pay of employed individuals\nwho have defaulted on their student\nloan obligations.See 20 U.S.C. 1095a;\n34 CFR 682.410.FMS drafted the NPRM\nafter consultation with the Departments\nof Education and Justice about their\nexperience implementing wage\ngarnishment to collect student loans.The comments received in response to\nthe NPRM based on the commenters’\nexperience with Education’s program\nhave been helpful in drafting the final\nrule.It is important to note that\nEducation’s wage garnishment program\nis applicable to the collection of one\ntype of debt subject to a single statutory\nscheme.The DCIA wage garnishment\nprovision and this rule, on the other\nhand, are applicable to all Federal\nagencies collecting all types of debt, the\ncollection of which is subject to a\nvariety of statutory provisions.Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(b) Scope\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\nincorrectly interpreted the DCIA in the\nNPRM by not limiting the applicability\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25137\n\nof administrative wage garnishment to\nthe collection of only those debts\nevidenced by written agreements.The\ncommenter believes that the language\ncontained in 31 U.S.C.3720D(a)\nauthorizing wage garnishment ‘‘if the\nindividual is not currently making\nrequired repayment in accordance with\nany agreement between the agency head\nand the individual’’ so limits the use of\nwage garnishment.FMS disagrees with\nthe commenter.There is nothing in the\nplain language of the statute to indicate\nthat the referenced phrase limits the\napplicability of wage garnishment to\ndebts evidenced by a written agreement.The term ‘‘debt,’’ as defined in 31 U.S.C.3701(b)(1), as amended by the DCIA, is\nnot limited to debts evidenced by a\nwritten agreement between the debtor\nand the Government.One commenter suggested that the\nrule establish a minimum threshold\namount for garnishment based on a cost\nestimate of the garnishment procedure.This is unnecessary since the use of the\nadministrative wage garnishment tool\nby agencies is voluntary and should be\nused by agencies in appropriate\nsituations.Agencies may set their own\npolicies regarding minimum thresholds.NPRM § 285.11(c) Definitions\n\nOne commenter suggested that the\n\ndefinition of agency under NPRM\n§ 285.11(c) be expanded to authorize\nagents or vendors of Federal agencies to\ngarnish debtors’ wages in accordance\nwith this rule.Whether or not an agent\nor vendor can perform a particular\nfunction on behalf of a Federal agency\nis beyond the scope of this rule.While\nthe use of contractors for the collection\nof debt generally is authorized by law,\nagencies may not contract out\n‘‘inherently governmental functions.’’\nSee Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) Circular A–76.This is not to say\nthat contractors cannot assist agencies\nin conducting administrative wage\ngarnishment.For example, contractors\ncould be hired to mail notices and\ngarnishment orders authorized by the\nagency, receive documents from the\ndebtor and the employer, and document\nagency-approved repayment agreements\nwith the debtor.NPRM § 285.11(d) General Rule\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\n\nclarify a statement in the NPRM\npreamble concerning NPRM § 285.11(d)\ninvolving the use of wage garnishment\nby Treasury-designated debt collection\ncenters.In addition to agencies that\nadminister the program that gives rise to\nthe debt, agencies that pursue the\nrecovery of the debt for those agencies,\nsuch as the Department of the Treasury,\n\nTreasury-designated debt collection\ncenters, and the Department of Justice,\nare authorized to conduct\nadministrative wage garnishment.See,\ne.g., the definition of ‘‘agency’’ in NPRM\n§ 285.11(c), unchanged in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(e) Notice\nRequirements\n\nThe suggestion by one commenter\nthat the rule specifically prohibit the\ncombination of an agency’s notice of\nintention to garnish a debtor’s wages\nwith other notices to the debtor has not\nbeen incorporated into this rule.The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.In\nmany circumstances, the debtor can be\ninformed clearly in a single\ncommunication of all debt collection\nremedies available to the Federal agency\nand the opportunities available to the\ndebtor to be heard concerning the\nexistence or amount of the debt.One commenter’s suggestion that FMS\ndevelop a standard administrative wage\ngarnishment notice for government-\nwide use has not been incorporated in\nthe final rule.Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.1692 et seq.,\nprovided that such entities comply with\nthe terms of this rule and use notices\nand forms developed by Treasury or\nother agencies.The extent to which the\nFDCPA may apply to any entity,\nparticularly private collection agencies,\nis outside the scope of this rule.Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.Other commenters\nsuggested that a certificate of service is\nunnecessary.The final rule retains the\nrequirement that an agency keep a\ncertificate of service as evidence of\nmailing.However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.Another\ncommenter questioned how an agency’s\n\nexisting hearing procedures for debt\ndetermination relate to the wage\ngarnishment requirements contained in\nthe DCIA and NPRM.The phrase\n‘‘consistent with this section’’ was\nadded to NPRM § 285.11(f)(1) in this\nfinal rule to clarify that agency\nregulations must follow the minimum\nrequirements for wage garnishment\nhearings as set forth in this rule.Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.Those agencies with hearings\nprocedures which meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand agency-specific statutory and other\nrequirements need not develop new\nhearing procedures.Agencies should\nseek legal advice from their agency\ncounsel to determine whether existing\nagency procedures meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand whether the agency is required to\npublish new or amended regulations.Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.One commenter recommended\namending NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) by\nestablishing that a debtor has 15\n‘‘calendar’’ days, rather than 15\n‘‘business’’ days, to request a hearing.FMS was concerned that 15 calendar\ndays would not allow sufficient time for\na debtor to request a hearing prior to the\nissuance of a garnishment order given\nthat 15 calendar days could include four\nto seven weekend days or holidays.For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.Several comments addressed the\nhearing procedures proposed in the\nNPRM.The final rule incorporates the\ncomment from two commenters\n\n\f25138\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nsuggesting that the requirement in\nNPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) that a debtor\nprove by ‘‘clear and convincing\nevidence’’ that no debt exists or that the\namount of the debt is incorrect is too\nburdensome.In the final rule at\n§ 285.11(f)(8)(ii), FMS replaced the\n‘‘clear and convincing’’ standard with\nthe less burdensome ‘‘preponderance of\nthe evidence’’ standard.One commenter suggested that\nproving the terms of the repayment\nschedule are ‘‘unreasonable,’’ as\nrequired at NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii), is\ntoo vague and that the debtor should be\nrequired to show that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule would cause a\n‘‘financial hardship’’ to the debtor.The\nfinal rule incorporates this suggestion.In response to a commenter’s\n\nsuggestion, NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the debtor\nmay present evidence that collection of\nthe debt may not be pursued due to\noperation of law, e.g., enforcement of\nthe order is subject to the automatic stay\nimposed at the time of a bankruptcy\nfiling pursuant to 11 U.S.C.362. Two commenters suggested that this\n\nrule restrict hearing officials to those\nindividuals not under the supervision or\ncontrol of the head of the agency.The\ncommenters suggested that the rule,\nwithout such a change, could result in\ninequitable wage garnishment hearing\ndecisions since an agency, and its\nqualified hearing officer, have a vested\ninterest in the outcome.FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.Unlike other statutes,\nsee, e.g., 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.Second, the rule explicitly sets forth\nminimum hearing procedures that\nensure the debtor has a meaningful\nopportunity to be heard and minimize\nthe risk of erroneous deprivation of the\ndebtor’s property interest in his or her\nwages.Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 706 (concerning\njudicial review of an agency’s actions).NPRM § 285.11(g) Wage Garnishment\nOrder\n\nOne commenter noted that the\nprovision under NPRM § 285.11(g)\nrequiring agencies to submit a wage\ngarnishment order to a debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days of a hearing\ndecision (or within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing) should be reconciled with the\n20 day period provided under\nEducation’s wage garnishment\n\nregulation at 34 CFR 682.410(b)(10)(H).Such a reconciliation with Education’s\nrule is not warranted or necessary.The\ntime period in this rule accommodates\na broad range of agencies’ requirements\nand is consistent with the goal of\nissuing a wage garnishment order\npromptly after notice and an\nopportunity to be heard have been\nprovided to the debtor.The final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(g)(2) be amended to delete the\nrequirement that the wage garnishment\norder be signed by the head of the\nagency or his/her designee.The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.Failure to include a signature on\na wage withholding order could result\nin employer uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the order and could result in\ndelay, and possible loss, of garnishment\npayments to which the Government is\nentitled.As noted in the NPRM and as\nsuggested by a commenter, FMS is\ndeveloping a wage garnishment order\nform.It is anticipated that the use of a\nstandard wage garnishment order form\nby agencies will make it easier for\nprivate sector employers to recognize\nand comply with agency wage\ngarnishment order requirements.This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.Nelson\nv. Diversified Collection Services, 961\nF.Supp. 863, 868–69 (D. Md. 1997).By\nrequiring an agency to retain a copy of\nthe certificate of service, the agency can\nproduce evidence that the order was\nmailed without having to place an\nadditional burden on the employer.One commenter suggested that the\nrequirement to comply with the wage\ngarnishment order should be waived\nunder circumstances when a small\n\nemployer (with less than five\nemployees) would be subject to a major\nhardship (financial or otherwise) as a\nresult of complying with the order.Such\na change to the rule is unnecessary since\nthe use of the wage garnishment\ncollection tool by agencies is not\nmandated under the DCIA.Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.NPRM § 285.11(h) Certification by\nEmployer\n\nThe final rule did not incorporate the\nrecommendation of two commenters to\ndelete the requirement under NPRM\n§ 285.11(h) requiring the debtor’s\nemployer to complete and return a\ncertification form to the agency.The\ncommenters suggested this provision is\nunduly burdensome and that an\nemployer’s failure to complete and\nreturn the form could unnecessarily\ndelay the garnishment process.The\ncertification form serves multiple\npurposes.One, the form provides the\nagency with information necessary to\nmonitor the employer’s compliance\nwith the wage garnishment order in\naccordance with the requirements of the\nDCIA and applicable laws.The form\nalso will provide information so the\nagency can calculate anticipated\ncollection amounts to determine\nwhether to pursue other collection tools.Finally, the form will assist the\nemployer in calculating the amount to\nbe garnished from the debtor’s\ndisposable pay.It is noted that the\nemployer’s failure to complete the\ncertification form as required does not\naffect the employer’s responsibility to\nwithhold the appropriate garnishment\namount within a ‘‘reasonable time’’ in\naccordance with this rule.See NPRM\n§ 285.11(i)(7), renumbered as\n§ 285.11(i)(8) in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(i) Amounts Withheld\nTwo commenters recommended\nclarifying the impact of the Consumer\nCredit Protection Act’s (CCPA)\nminimum disposable pay requirement\non the wage garnishment provisions of\nthe DCIA and this rule.See CCPA,\n§ 303(a)(2), codified at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (maximum allowable\ngarnishment).NPRM § 285.11(i) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the amount\nof garnishment is limited by the CCPA.Under section 285.11(i) of the final rule,\nthe amount of garnishment is the lesser\nof the amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay or the amount\nset forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2). The\namount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2)\nis the amount by which a debtor’s\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25139\n\ndisposable pay exceeds an amount\nequivalent to thirty times the minimum\nwage.For example, if a debtor receives\ndisposable pay of $160.00 per week and\nthirty times the minimum wage is\n$154.50, the amount that may be\ngarnished weekly is the lesser of $24.00\n(15% of $160) or $5.50 ($160.00–\n$154.40 = $5.50).See 29 CFR\n870.10(b)(1) for information on\ncalculating an amount equivalent to\nthirty times the minimum wage.Section 285.11(i)(3) of the final rule is\nthe same as NPRM § 285.11(i)(2) except\nthat § 285.11(i)(3)(iii) has been added to\nclarify the amount of garnishment for a\ndebtor who owes multiple debts to a\nsingle creditor agency.Under section\n285(i)(3)(iii) of the final rule, an agency\nmay issue multiple withholding orders\nso long as the total amount garnished\nfrom the debtor’s pay for such orders\ndoes not exceed the garnishment\namount permitted under § 285.11(i)(2).For purposes of § 285.11(i)(3)(iii), the\nterm ‘‘agency’’ refers to the agency that\nis owed the debt.One commenter suggested deleting\n\nthe language in NPRM § 285.11(i)(7)\n(renumbered as § 285.11(i)(8) in the\nfinal rule) requiring that the wage\ngarnishment order ‘‘indicate a\nreasonable period of time within which\nthe employer is required to commence\nwage withholding’’ because\ngarnishment orders in all other contexts\ntypically require immediate compliance.This suggestion was not incorporated\ninto the final rule.The ‘‘reasonable\nperiod of time’’ given to employers\nallows employers adequate time to\ncalculate garnishment withholding\npayroll data involving a debtor\nemployee without disrupting the normal\npayroll cycle.It is anticipated that a\n‘‘reasonable period of time’’ generally\nwill mean that the employer will\ncommence withholdings within two pay\ncycles following receipt of the\ngarnishment order.This may vary given\nan employer’s circumstances.NPRM § 285.11(j) Exclusions From\nGarnishment.No changes were made to the NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(k) Financial Hardship\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(k) be amended further to define\nthe standards for agency review of a\ndebtor’s request for an adjustment in the\namount withheld under a wage\ngarnishment order due to ‘‘financial\nhardship’’ based on ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances.’’ NPRM § 285.11(k),\nunchanged in the final rule, provides\n\nillustrative examples of the type of\nevents which may give rise to financial\nhardship due to ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances,’’ such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness.However, whether financial hardship\nexists must be determined by an\nagency’s review of the particular facts\nand circumstances of a given case.NPRM § 285.11(l) Ending Garnishment\nThe final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that the rule\nclarify whether collection costs need to\nbe collected before terminating the\ngarnishment action.NPRM § 285.11(l),\nunchanged in the final rule, clearly\nrequires termination of garnishment\nonly after the agency ‘‘has fully\nrecovered the amounts owed by the\ndebtor, including interest, penalties and\nadministrative costs consistent with the\nFCCS (Federal Claims Collection\nStandards).’’ See 31 U.S.C.3717(e) and\n4 CFR 102.13 regarding the collection of\nadministrative costs associated with a\ndebt.NPRM § 285.11(m) Actions Prohibited\nby the Employer\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(m).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(n) Refunds\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(o) Right of Action.The final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) be amended to remove the\nrequirement that a Federal agency must\n‘‘terminate collection action’’ as a\nprerequisite to commencing suit against\na debtor’s employer for failure to\nwithhold amounts from wages pursuant\nto a wage garnishment order.The DCIA\nspecifically provides that ‘‘suit (against\nan employer) may not be filed before the\ntermination of the collection action,\nunless earlier filing is necessary to avoid\nexpiration of any applicable statute of\nlimitations period.’’ 31 U.S.C. 3720D(f)(2)(B).However, FMS has amended NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(o) in the final rule to\nincorporate a suggestion by another\ncommenter that the rule be changed to\nclarify that ‘‘termination of the\ncollection action’’ merely refers to the\nparticular debtor/employee, rather than\nthe debt.This change gives agencies\nflexibility to terminate collection action\nagainst one of the debtors and file suit\nagainst that debtor’s employer for failing\nto withhold that debtor’s wages\npursuant to a wage garnishment order.At the same time, the agency could\ncontinue collection efforts involving the\nother debtors who are jointly and\nseverally liable to the agency on the\ndebt.Regulatory Analysis\n\nThis rule is not a significant\nregulatory action as defined in\nExecutive Order 12866.It is hereby\ncertified that this regulation, including\nthe certification referenced in this final\nrule (see paragraph (h) of this section),\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities.Although a substantial number\nof small entities will be subject to this\nregulation and to the certification\nrequirement in this rule, the\nrequirements will not have a significant\neconomic impact on these entities.Employers of delinquent debtors must\ncertify certain information about the\ndebtor such as the debtor’s employment\nstatus and earnings.This information is\ncontained in the employer’s payroll\nrecords.Therefore, it will not take a\nsignificant amount of time or result in\na significant cost for an employer to\ncomplete the certification form.Even if\nan employer is served withholding\norders on several employees over the\ncourse of a year, the cost imposed on the\nemployer to complete the certifications\nwould not have a significant economic\nimpact on that entity.Employers are not\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with a withholding\norder issued pursuant to this rule.List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 285\n\nAdministrative practice and\n\nprocedure, Claims, Debts, Garnishment\nof wages, Hearing and appeal\nprocedures, Salaries, Wages.Authority and Issuance\n\nFor the reasons set forth in the\n\npreamble, 31 CFR part 285 is amended\nas follows:\n\nPART 285—DEBT COLLECTION\nAUTHORITIES UNDER THE DEBT\nCOLLECTION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF\n1996\n\n1.The authority citation for part 285\n\nis revised to read as follows:\n\nAuthority: 26 U.S.C.6402; 31 U.S.C. 321,\n3701, 3711, 3716, 3720A, 3720D; E.O.13019;\n3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 216. 2.Section 285.11 is added to Subpart\n\nB to read as follows:\n\n§ 285.11 Administrative wage\ngarnishment. (a) Purpose.This section provides\n\nprocedures for Federal agencies to\ncollect money from a debtor’s\n\n\f25140\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\ndisposable pay by means of\nadministrative wage garnishment to\nsatisfy delinquent nontax debt owed to\nthe United States. (b) Scope.(1) This section applies to\nany Federal agency that administers a\nprogram that gives rise to a delinquent\nnontax debt owed to the United States\nand to any agency that pursues recovery\nof such debt.(2) This section shall apply\n\nnotwithstanding any provision of State\nlaw.(3) Nothing in this section precludes\n\nthe compromise of a debt or the\nsuspension or termination of collection\naction in accordance with applicable\nlaw.See, for example, the Federal\nClaims Collection Standards (FCCS), 4\nCFR parts 101–105.(4) The receipt of payments pursuant\n\nto this section does not preclude a\nFederal agency from pursuing other debt\ncollection remedies, including the offset\nof Federal payments to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.A Federal agency may\npursue such debt collection remedies\nseparately or in conjunction with\nadministrative wage garnishment.(5) This section does not apply to the\n\ncollection of delinquent nontax debt\nowed to the United States from the\nwages of Federal employees from their\nFederal employment.Federal pay is\nsubject to the Federal salary offset\nprocedures set forth in 5 U.S.C.5514\nand other applicable laws.(6) Nothing in this section requires\n\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.the following definitions shall apply:\n\nAgency means a department, agency,\n\ncourt, court administrative office, or\ninstrumentality in the executive,\njudicial, or legislative branch of the\nFederal Government, including\ngovernment corporations.For purposes\nof this section, agency means either the\nagency that administers the program\nthat gave rise to the debt or the agency\nthat pursues recovery of the debt.Business day means Monday through\n\nFriday.For purposes of computation,\nthe last day of the period will be\nincluded unless it is a Federal legal\nholiday.Certificate of service means a\n\ncertificate signed by an agency official\nindicating the nature of the document to\nwhich it pertains, the date of mailing of\nthe document, and to whom the\ndocument is being sent.Day means calendar day. For\n\npurposes of computation, the last day of\nthe period will be included unless it is\n\na Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal legal\nholiday.Debt or claim means any amount of\nmoney, funds or property that has been\ndetermined by an appropriate official of\nthe Federal Government to be owed to\nthe United States by an individual,\nincluding debt administered by a third\nparty as an agent for the Federal\nGovernment.Delinquent nontax debt\nmeans any nontax debt that has not\nbeen paid by the date specified in the\nagency’s initial written demand for\npayment, or applicable agreement,\nunless other satisfactory payment\narrangements have been made.For\npurposes of this section, the terms\n‘‘debt’’ and ‘‘claim’’ are synonymous\nand refer to delinquent nontax debt.Debtor means an individual who owes\n\na delinquent nontax debt to the United\nStates.Disposable pay means that part of the\n\ndebtor’s compensation (including, but\nnot limited to, salary, bonuses,\ncommissions, and vacation pay) from an\nemployer remaining after the deduction\nof health insurance premiums and any\namounts required by law to be withheld.For purposes of this section, ‘‘amounts\nrequired by law to be withheld’’ include\namounts for deductions such as social\nsecurity taxes and withholding taxes,\nbut do not include any amount withheld\npursuant to a court order.Employer means a person or entity\nthat employs the services of others and\nthat pays their wages or salaries.The\nterm employer includes, but is not\nlimited to, State and local Governments,\nbut does not include an agency of the\nFederal Government.withholding amounts from an\nemployee’s disposable pay and the\npaying of those amounts to a creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.Withholding order means any order\nfor withholding or garnishment of pay\nissued by an agency, or judicial or\nadministrative body.For purposes of\nthis section, the terms ‘‘wage\ngarnishment order’’ and ‘‘garnishment\norder’’ have the same meaning as\n‘‘withholding order.’’\n\n(d) General rule.Whenever an agency\n\ndetermines that a delinquent debt is\nowed by an individual, the agency may\ninitiate proceedings administratively to\ngarnish the wages of the delinquent\ndebtor. (e) Notice requirements.(1) At least 30\ndays before the initiation of garnishment\nproceedings, the agency shall mail, by\nfirst class mail, to the debtor’s last\nknown address a written notice\ninforming the debtor of:\n\n(i) The nature and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The intention of the agency to\ninitiate proceedings to collect the debt\nthrough deductions from pay until the\ndebt and all accumulated interest,\npenalties and administrative costs are\npaid in full; and\n\n(iii) An explanation of the debtor’s\n\nrights, including those set forth in\nparagraph (e)(2) of this section, and the\ntime frame within which the debtor may\nexercise his or her rights.(2) The debtor shall be afforded the\n\nopportunity:\n\n(i) To inspect and copy agency\n\nrecords related to the debt;\n\n(ii) To enter into a written repayment\nagreement with the agency under terms\nagreeable to the agency; and\n\n(iii) For a hearing in accordance with\nparagraph (f) of this section concerning\nthe existence or the amount of the debt\nor the terms of the proposed repayment\nschedule under the garnishment order.However, the debtor is not entitled to a\nhearing concerning the terms of the\nproposed repayment schedule if these\nterms have been established by written\nagreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of\nthis section.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the notice.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes. (f) Hearing—(1) In general.Agencies\n\nshall prescribe regulations for the\nconduct of administrative wage\ngarnishment hearings consistent with\nthis section or shall adopt this section\nwithout change by reference. (2) Request for hearing.The agency\nshall provide a hearing, which at the\nagency’s option may be oral or written,\nif the debtor submits a written request\nfor a hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt or the terms of the\nrepayment schedule (for repayment\nschedules established other than by\nwritten agreement under paragraph\n(e)(2)(ii)) of this section.(3) Type of hearing or review.(i) For\npurposes of this section, whenever an\nagency is required to afford a debtor a\nhearing, the agency shall provide the\ndebtor with a reasonable opportunity for\nan oral hearing when the agency\ndetermines that the issues in dispute\ncannot be resolved by review of the\ndocumentary evidence, for example,\nwhen the validity of the claim turns on\nthe issue of credibility or veracity.(ii) If the agency determines that an\noral hearing is appropriate, the time and\nlocation of the hearing shall be\nestablished by the agency.(iii) In those cases when an oral\n\nhearing is not required by this section,\nan agency shall nevertheless accord the\ndebtor a ‘‘paper hearing,’’ that is, an\nagency will decide the issues in dispute\nbased upon a review of the written\nrecord.(5) Failure to timely request a hearing.If the debtor’s written request is\nreceived by the agency after the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall provide\na hearing to the debtor.(6) Hearing official. A hearing official\n\nmay be any qualified individual, as\ndetermined by the head of the agency,\nincluding an administrative law judge. (7) Procedure.After the debtor\n\nrequests a hearing, the hearing official\nshall notify the debtor of:\n\n(i) The date and time of a telephonic\n\nhearing;\n\n(ii) The date, time, and location of an\n\nin-person oral hearing; or\n\n(iii) The deadline for the submission\n\nof evidence for a written hearing.(8) Burden of proof. (i) The agency\nwill have the burden of going forward\nto prove the existence or amount of the\ndebt.In addition, the debtor may present\nevidence that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule are unlawful,\nwould cause a financial hardship to the\n\ndebtor, or that collection of the debt\nmay not be pursued due to operation of\nlaw.(9) Record. The hearing official must\n\nmaintain a summary record of any\nhearing provided under this section.A\nhearing is not required to be a formal\nevidentiary-type hearing, however,\nwitnesses who testify in oral hearings\nwill do so under oath or affirmation. (10) Date of decision.The hearing\nofficial shall issue a written opinion\nstating his or her decision, as soon as\npracticable, but not later than sixty (60)\ndays after the date on which the request\nfor such hearing was received by the\nagency.If an agency is unable to provide\nthe debtor with a hearing and render a\ndecision within 60 days after the receipt\nof the request for such hearing:\n\n(i) The agency may not issue a\n\nwithholding order until the hearing is\nheld and a decision rendered; or\n\n(ii) If the agency had previously\nissued a withholding order to the\ndebtor’s employer, the agency must\nsuspend the withholding order\nbeginning on the 61st day after the\nreceipt of the hearing request and\ncontinuing until a hearing is held and\na decision is rendered.(11) Content of decision. The written\n\ndecision shall include:\n\n(i) A summary of the facts presented;\n(ii) The hearing official’s findings,\n\nanalysis and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment\n\nschedules, if applicable.(12) Final agency action. The hearing\n\nofficial’s decision will be the final\nagency action for the purposes of\njudicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.701 et seq.). (13) Failure to appear.(1)\n\nUnless the agency receives information\nthat the agency believes justifies a delay\nor cancellation of the withholding order,\nthe agency shall send, by first class\nmail, a withholding order to the debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing (i.e., within 15 business days\nafter the mailing of the notice described\nin paragraph (e)(1) of this section), or, if\na timely request for a hearing is made\nby the debtor, within 30 days after a\nfinal decision is made by the agency to\nproceed with garnishment.(2) The withholding order sent to the\nemployer under paragraph (g)(1) of this\nsection shall be in a form prescribed by\nthe Secretary of the Treasury on the\n\nagency’s letterhead and signed by the\nhead of the agency or his/her delegatee.The order shall contain only the\ninformation necessary for the employer\nto comply with the withholding order.Such information includes the debtor’s\nname, address, and social security\nnumber, as well as instructions for\nwithholding and information as to\nwhere payments should be sent.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the order.(h) Certification by employer.Along\nwith the withholding order, the agency\nshall send to the employer a\ncertification in a form prescribed by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The employer\nshall complete and return the\ncertification to the agency within the\ntime frame prescribed in the\ninstructions to the form.The\ncertification will address matters such\nas information about the debtor’s\nemployment status and disposable pay\navailable for withholding. (i) Amounts withheld.(1) After receipt\n\nof the garnishment order issued under\nthis section, the employer shall deduct\nfrom all disposable pay paid to the\napplicable debtor during each pay\nperiod the amount of garnishment\ndescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this\nsection.(2)(i) Subject to the provisions of\n\nparagraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this\nsection, the amount of garnishment\nshall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay; or\n\n(B) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment).The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a\ndebtor’s disposable pay exceeds an\namount equivalent to thirty times the\nminimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, withholding orders for\nfamily support shall have priority over\nwithholding orders issued under this\nsection.(ii) If amounts are being withheld\n\nfrom a debtor’s pay pursuant to a\nwithholding order served on an\nemployer before a withholding order\n\n\f25142\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nissued pursuant to this section, or if a\nwithholding order for family support is\nserved on an employer at any time, the\namounts withheld pursuant to the\nwithholding order issued under this\nsection shall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under\n\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of the\n\ndebtor’s disposable pay less the\namount(s) withheld under the\nwithholding order(s) with priority.(iii) If a debtor owes more than one\ndebt to an agency, the agency may issue\nmultiple withholding orders provided\nthat the total amount garnished from the\ndebtor’s pay for such orders does not\nexceed the amount set forth in\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section.For\npurposes of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the\nterm agency refers to the agency that is\nowed the debt.(7) Any assignment or allotment by an\n\nemployee of his earnings shall be void\nto the extent it interferes with or\nprohibits execution of the withholding\norder issued under this section, except\nfor any assignment or allotment made\npursuant to a family support judgment\nor order.(8) The employer shall withhold the\nappropriate amount from the debtor’s\nwages for each pay period until the\nemployer receives notification from the\nagency to discontinue wage\nwithholding.The garnishment order\nshall indicate a reasonable period of\n\ntime within which the employer is\nrequired to commence wage\nwithholding.(j) Exclusions from garnishment.The debtor has the burden of\ninforming the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. (k) Financial hardship.(1) A debtor\n\nwhose wages are subject to a wage\nwithholding order under this section,\nmay, at any time, request a review by\nthe agency of the amount garnished,\nbased on materially changed\ncircumstances such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness which\nresult in financial hardship.Agencies shall consider\nany information submitted in\naccordance with procedures and\nstandards established by the agency.(3) If a financial hardship is found,\nthe agency shall downwardly adjust, by\nan amount and for a period of time\nagreeable to the agency, the amount\ngarnished to reflect the debtor’s\nfinancial condition.The agency will\nnotify the employer of any adjustments\nto the amounts to be withheld. (l) Ending garnishment.(1) Once the\nagency has fully recovered the amounts\nowed by the debtor, including interest,\npenalties, and administrative costs\nconsistent with the FCCS, the agency\nshall send the debtor’s employer\nnotification to discontinue wage\nwithholding.(2) At least annually, an agency shall\n\nreview its debtors’ accounts to ensure\nthat garnishment has been terminated\nfor accounts that have been paid in full.(m) Actions prohibited by the\nemployer.An employer may not\ndischarge, refuse to employ, or take\ndisciplinary action against the debtor\ndue to the issuance of a withholding\norder under this section. (n) Refunds.(1) If a hearing official, at\n\na hearing held pursuant to paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section, determines that a\ndebt is not legally due and owing to the\nUnited States, the agency shall promptly\nrefund any amount collected by means\nof administrative wage garnishment.(2) Unless required by Federal law or\n\ncontract, refunds under this section\nshall not bear interest. (o) Right of action.The agency may\nsue any employer for any amount that\nthe employer fails to withhold from\nwages owed and payable to an employee\nin accordance with paragraphs (g) and\n(i) of this section.However, a suit may\nnot be filed before the termination of the\ncollection action involving a particular\ndebtor, unless earlier filing is necessary\nto avoid expiration of any applicable\nstatute of limitations period.For\npurposes of this section, ‘‘termination of\nthe collection action’’ occurs when the\nagency has terminated collection action\nin accordance with the FCCS or other\napplicable standards.In any event,\ntermination of the collection action will\nhave been deemed to occur if the agency\nhas not received any payments to satisfy\nthe debt from the particular debtor\nwhose wages were subject to\ngarnishment, in whole or in part, for a\nperiod of one (1) year.Dated: April 30, 1998.

SUMMARY: This final rule implements\nthe administrative wage garnishment\nprovisions contained in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996\n(DCIA).Wage garnishment is a process\nwhereby an employer withholds\namounts from an employee’s wages and\npays those amounts to the employee’s\ncreditor in satisfaction of a withholding\norder.The DCIA authorizes Federal\nagencies administratively to garnish the\ndisposable pay of an individual to\ncollect delinquent nontax debts owed to\nthe United States in accordance with\nregulations issued by the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.DATES: This rule is effective June 5,\n1998.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nGerry Isenberg, Financial Program\nSpecialist, Debt Management Services,\nat (202) 874–6660 or James Regan,\nAttorney-Advisor, at (202) 874–6680,\nFinancial Management Service,\nDepartment of the Treasury, 401 14th\nStreet SW, Washington, DC 20227.The\nDCIA authorizes Federal agencies\nadministratively to garnish up to 15% of\nthe disposable pay of a debtor to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.The Financial\nManagement Service (FMS), a bureau of\nthe Department of the Treasury, is\nresponsible for promulgating the\nregulations implementing this and other\ndebt collection tools established by the\nDCIA.In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.2. Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.The debtor bears the\nburden of informing the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. 3.This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.The DCIA prohibits employers from\ntaking disciplinary actions against the\ndebtor based on the fact that the debtor’s\nwages are subject to administrative\ngarnishment.Discussion of Comments\n\nGeneral\n\nIn response to its Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking (NPRM) concerning\nAdministrative Wage Garnishment (62\nFR 62458, Nov. 21, 1997), FMS received\ncomments from Federal agencies,\nprivate collection agencies, an umbrella\norganization for organizations that\nsupport the activities of the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Programs, and a\nprivate citizen.The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.The term ‘‘debt,’’ as defined in 31 U.S.C.3701(b)(1), as amended by the DCIA, is\nnot limited to debts evidenced by a\nwritten agreement between the debtor\nand the Government.One commenter suggested that the\nrule establish a minimum threshold\namount for garnishment based on a cost\nestimate of the garnishment procedure.NPRM § 285.11(d) General Rule\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\n\nclarify a statement in the NPRM\npreamble concerning NPRM § 285.11(d)\ninvolving the use of wage garnishment\nby Treasury-designated debt collection\ncenters.In addition to agencies that\nadminister the program that gives rise to\nthe debt, agencies that pursue the\nrecovery of the debt for those agencies,\nsuch as the Department of the Treasury,\n\nTreasury-designated debt collection\ncenters, and the Department of Justice,\nare authorized to conduct\nadministrative wage garnishment.See,\ne.g., the definition of ‘‘agency’’ in NPRM\n§ 285.11(c), unchanged in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(e) Notice\nRequirements\n\nThe suggestion by one commenter\nthat the rule specifically prohibit the\ncombination of an agency’s notice of\nintention to garnish a debtor’s wages\nwith other notices to the debtor has not\nbeen incorporated into this rule.The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.In\nmany circumstances, the debtor can be\ninformed clearly in a single\ncommunication of all debt collection\nremedies available to the Federal agency\nand the opportunities available to the\ndebtor to be heard concerning the\nexistence or amount of the debt.Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.1692 et seq.,\nprovided that such entities comply with\nthe terms of this rule and use notices\nand forms developed by Treasury or\nother agencies.The extent to which the\nFDCPA may apply to any entity,\nparticularly private collection agencies,\nis outside the scope of this rule.Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.Other commenters\nsuggested that a certificate of service is\nunnecessary.The final rule retains the\nrequirement that an agency keep a\ncertificate of service as evidence of\nmailing.However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.Another\ncommenter questioned how an agency’s\n\nexisting hearing procedures for debt\ndetermination relate to the wage\ngarnishment requirements contained in\nthe DCIA and NPRM.The phrase\n‘‘consistent with this section’’ was\nadded to NPRM § 285.11(f)(1) in this\nfinal rule to clarify that agency\nregulations must follow the minimum\nrequirements for wage garnishment\nhearings as set forth in this rule.Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.Agencies should\nseek legal advice from their agency\ncounsel to determine whether existing\nagency procedures meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand whether the agency is required to\npublish new or amended regulations.Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.FMS was concerned that 15 calendar\ndays would not allow sufficient time for\na debtor to request a hearing prior to the\nissuance of a garnishment order given\nthat 15 calendar days could include four\nto seven weekend days or holidays.For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.The final rule incorporates the\ncomment from two commenters\n\n\f25138\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nsuggesting that the requirement in\nNPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) that a debtor\nprove by ‘‘clear and convincing\nevidence’’ that no debt exists or that the\namount of the debt is incorrect is too\nburdensome.In the final rule at\n§ 285.11(f)(8)(ii), FMS replaced the\n‘‘clear and convincing’’ standard with\nthe less burdensome ‘‘preponderance of\nthe evidence’’ standard.One commenter suggested that\nproving the terms of the repayment\nschedule are ‘‘unreasonable,’’ as\nrequired at NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii), is\ntoo vague and that the debtor should be\nrequired to show that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule would cause a\n‘‘financial hardship’’ to the debtor.362. Two commenters suggested that this\n\nrule restrict hearing officials to those\nindividuals not under the supervision or\ncontrol of the head of the agency.The\ncommenters suggested that the rule,\nwithout such a change, could result in\ninequitable wage garnishment hearing\ndecisions since an agency, and its\nqualified hearing officer, have a vested\ninterest in the outcome.FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.Unlike other statutes,\nsee, e.g., 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.Second, the rule explicitly sets forth\nminimum hearing procedures that\nensure the debtor has a meaningful\nopportunity to be heard and minimize\nthe risk of erroneous deprivation of the\ndebtor’s property interest in his or her\nwages.Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 706 (concerning\njudicial review of an agency’s actions).The final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(g)(2) be amended to delete the\nrequirement that the wage garnishment\norder be signed by the head of the\nagency or his/her designee.The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.As noted in the NPRM and as\nsuggested by a commenter, FMS is\ndeveloping a wage garnishment order\nform.This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.Nelson\nv.

Md. 1997).Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.NPRM § 285.11(h) Certification by\nEmployer\n\nThe final rule did not incorporate the\nrecommendation of two commenters to\ndelete the requirement under NPRM\n§ 285.11(h) requiring the debtor’s\nemployer to complete and return a\ncertification form to the agency.The\ncommenters suggested this provision is\nunduly burdensome and that an\nemployer’s failure to complete and\nreturn the form could unnecessarily\ndelay the garnishment process.The\ncertification form serves multiple\npurposes.It is noted that the\nemployer’s failure to complete the\ncertification form as required does not\naffect the employer’s responsibility to\nwithhold the appropriate garnishment\namount within a ‘‘reasonable time’’ in\naccordance with this rule.See NPRM\n§ 285.11(i)(7), renumbered as\n§ 285.11(i)(8) in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(i) Amounts Withheld\nTwo commenters recommended\nclarifying the impact of the Consumer\nCredit Protection Act’s (CCPA)\nminimum disposable pay requirement\non the wage garnishment provisions of\nthe DCIA and this rule.NPRM § 285.11(i) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the amount\nof garnishment is limited by the CCPA.Under section 285.11(i) of the final rule,\nthe amount of garnishment is the lesser\nof the amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay or the amount\nset forth in 15 U.S.C.For purposes of § 285.11(i)(3)(iii), the\nterm ‘‘agency’’ refers to the agency that\nis owed the debt.One commenter suggested deleting\n\nthe language in NPRM § 285.11(i)(7)\n(renumbered as § 285.11(i)(8) in the\nfinal rule) requiring that the wage\ngarnishment order ‘‘indicate a\nreasonable period of time within which\nthe employer is required to commence\nwage withholding’’ because\ngarnishment orders in all other contexts\ntypically require immediate compliance.This suggestion was not incorporated\ninto the final rule.The ‘‘reasonable\nperiod of time’’ given to employers\nallows employers adequate time to\ncalculate garnishment withholding\npayroll data involving a debtor\nemployee without disrupting the normal\npayroll cycle.It is anticipated that a\n‘‘reasonable period of time’’ generally\nwill mean that the employer will\ncommence withholdings within two pay\ncycles following receipt of the\ngarnishment order.This may vary given\nan employer’s circumstances.NPRM § 285.11(j) Exclusions From\nGarnishment.No changes were made to the NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(n).NPRM § 285.11(l) Ending Garnishment\nThe final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that the rule\nclarify whether collection costs need to\nbe collected before terminating the\ngarnishment action.NPRM § 285.11(l),\nunchanged in the final rule, clearly\nrequires termination of garnishment\nonly after the agency ‘‘has fully\nrecovered the amounts owed by the\ndebtor, including interest, penalties and\nadministrative costs consistent with the\nFCCS (Federal Claims Collection\nStandards).’’ See 31 U.S.C.Subject to\n\nparagraph (f)(13) of this section, if the\ndebtor’s written request is received by\nthe agency on or before the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall not\nissue a withholding order under\nparagraph (g) of this section until the\ndebtor has been provided the requested\nhearing and a decision in accordance\nwith paragraphs (f)(10) and (f)(11) of\nthis section has been rendered.(5) Failure to timely request a hearing.If the debtor’s written request is\nreceived by the agency after the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall provide\na hearing to the debtor.However, the\nagency will not delay issuance of a\nwithholding order unless the agency\ndetermines that the delay in filing the\nrequest was caused by factors over\nwhich the debtor had no control, or the\nagency receives information that the\nagency believes justifies a delay or\ncancellation of the withholding order.(12) Final agency action. The hearing\n\nofficial’s decision will be the final\nagency action for the purposes of\njudicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.(h) Certification by employer.Along\nwith the withholding order, the agency\nshall send to the employer a\ncertification in a form prescribed by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.(2)(i) Subject to the provisions of\n\nparagraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this\nsection, the amount of garnishment\nshall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay; or\n\n(B) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment).The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a\ndebtor’s disposable pay exceeds an\namount equivalent to thirty times the\nminimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.(3) When a debtor’s pay is subject to\n\nwithholding orders with priority the\nfollowing shall apply:\n\n(i) Unless otherwise provided by\nFederal law, withholding orders issued\nunder this section shall be paid in the\namounts set forth under paragraph (i)(2)\nof this section and shall have priority\nover other withholding orders which are\nserved later in time.Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, withholding orders for\nfamily support shall have priority over\nwithholding orders issued under this\nsection.(ii) If amounts are being withheld\n\nfrom a debtor’s pay pursuant to a\nwithholding order served on an\nemployer before a withholding order\n\n\f25142\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nissued pursuant to this section, or if a\nwithholding order for family support is\nserved on an employer at any time, the\namounts withheld pursuant to the\nwithholding order issued under this\nsection shall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under\n\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of the\n\ndebtor’s disposable pay less the\namount(s) withheld under the\nwithholding order(s) with priority.(iii) If a debtor owes more than one\ndebt to an agency, the agency may issue\nmultiple withholding orders provided\nthat the total amount garnished from the\ndebtor’s pay for such orders does not\nexceed the amount set forth in\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section.(j) Exclusions from garnishment.The\nagency may not garnish the wages of a\ndebtor who it knows has been\ninvoluntarily separated from\nemployment until the debtor has been\nreemployed continuously for at least 12\nmonths.The debtor has the burden of\ninforming the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. (k) Financial hardship.(2) Unless required by Federal law or\n\ncontract, refunds under this section\nshall not bear interest. (o) Right of action.The agency may\nsue any employer for any amount that\nthe employer fails to withhold from\nwages owed and payable to an employee\nin accordance with paragraphs (g) and\n(i) of this section.However, a suit may\nnot be filed before the termination of the\ncollection action involving a particular\ndebtor, unless earlier filing is necessary\nto avoid expiration of any applicable\nstatute of limitations period.For\npurposes of this section, ‘‘termination of\nthe collection action’’ occurs when the\nagency has terminated collection action\nin accordance with the FCCS or other\napplicable standards.In any event,\ntermination of the collection action will\nhave been deemed to occur if the agency\nhas not received any payments to satisfy\nthe debt from the particular debtor\nwhose wages were subject to\ngarnishment, in whole or in part, for a\nperiod of one (1) year.98–11966 Filed 5–5–98; 8:45 am]\n\nBILLING  CODE  4810–35–P",

SUMMARY: This final rule implements\nthe administrative wage garnishment\nprovisions contained in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996\n(DCIA).Wage garnishment is a process\nwhereby an employer withholds\namounts from an employee’s wages and\npays those amounts to the employee’s\ncreditor in satisfaction of a withholding\norder.The DCIA authorizes Federal\nagencies administratively to garnish the\ndisposable pay of an individual to\ncollect delinquent nontax debts owed to\nthe United States in accordance with\nregulations issued by the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nGerry Isenberg, Financial Program\nSpecialist, Debt Management Services,\nat (202) 874–6660 or James Regan,\nAttorney-Advisor, at (202) 874–6680,\nFinancial Management Service,\nDepartment of the Treasury, 401 14th\nStreet SW, Washington, DC 20227.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\nThis final rule implements the wage\n\ngarnishment provision in section\n31001(o) of the Debt Collection\nImprovement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Pub.Wage garnishment is a process whereby\nan employer withholds amounts from\nan employee’s wages and pays those\namounts to the employee’s creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.The\nDCIA authorizes Federal agencies\nadministratively to garnish up to 15% of\nthe disposable pay of a debtor to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.Prior to the enactment of\nthe DCIA, agencies were required to\nobtain a court judgment before\ngarnishing the wages of non-Federal\nemployees.Section 31001(o) of the\nDCIA preempts State laws that prohibit\nwage garnishment or otherwise govern\nwage garnishment procedures.As authorized by the DCIA, a Federal\n\nagency collecting delinquent nontax\ndebt may garnish administratively a\ndelinquent debtor’s wages in accordance\nwith regulations promulgated by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The Financial\nManagement Service (FMS), a bureau of\nthe Department of the Treasury, is\nresponsible for promulgating the\nregulations implementing this and other\ndebt collection tools established by the\nDCIA.In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.2. Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.For hearing requests\nthat are not received in the specified\ntime frame, an agency need not delay\nissuance of the withholding order prior\nto conducting a hearing.An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.The debtor bears the\nburden of informing the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. 3.Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.The DCIA prohibits employers from\ntaking disciplinary actions against the\ndebtor based on the fact that the debtor’s\nwages are subject to administrative\ngarnishment.In addition, the DCIA\n\nauthorizes an agency to sue an employer\nfor amounts not properly withheld from\nthe wages payable to the debtor.Discussion of Comments\n\nGeneral\n\nIn response to its Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking (NPRM) concerning\nAdministrative Wage Garnishment (62\nFR 62458, Nov. 21, 1997), FMS received\ncomments from Federal agencies,\nprivate collection agencies, an umbrella\norganization for organizations that\nsupport the activities of the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Programs, and a\nprivate citizen.Many of the commenters\nhave been involved in implementing a\nsimilar administrative wage\ngarnishment provision that authorizes\nthe U.S. Department of Education\n(Education) to garnish 10% of the\ndisposable pay of employed individuals\nwho have defaulted on their student\nloan obligations.See 20 U.S.C. 1095a;\n34 CFR 682.410.FMS drafted the NPRM\nafter consultation with the Departments\nof Education and Justice about their\nexperience implementing wage\ngarnishment to collect student loans.Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.One commenter recommended\namending NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) by\nestablishing that a debtor has 15\n‘‘calendar’’ days, rather than 15\n‘‘business’’ days, to request a hearing.For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.Nelson\nv. Diversified Collection Services, 961\nF.Supp. 863, 868–69 (D. Md. 1997).Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.The\ncertification form serves multiple\npurposes.The form\nalso will provide information so the\nagency can calculate anticipated\ncollection amounts to determine\nwhether to pursue other collection tools.Finally, the form will assist the\nemployer in calculating the amount to\nbe garnished from the debtor’s\ndisposable pay.It is noted that the\nemployer’s failure to complete the\ncertification form as required does not\naffect the employer’s responsibility to\nwithhold the appropriate garnishment\namount within a ‘‘reasonable time’’ in\naccordance with this rule.See NPRM\n§ 285.11(i)(7), renumbered as\n§ 285.11(i)(8) in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(i) Amounts Withheld\nTwo commenters recommended\nclarifying the impact of the Consumer\nCredit Protection Act’s (CCPA)\nminimum disposable pay requirement\non the wage garnishment provisions of\nthe DCIA and this rule.See CCPA,\n§ 303(a)(2), codified at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (maximum allowable\ngarnishment).1673(a)(2)\nis the amount by which a debtor’s\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.Section 285.11(i)(3) of the final rule is\nthe same as NPRM § 285.11(i)(2) except\nthat § 285.11(i)(3)(iii) has been added to\nclarify the amount of garnishment for a\ndebtor who owes multiple debts to a\nsingle creditor agency.For purposes of § 285.11(i)(3)(iii), the\nterm ‘‘agency’’ refers to the agency that\nis owed the debt.One commenter suggested deleting\n\nthe language in NPRM § 285.11(i)(7)\n(renumbered as § 285.11(i)(8) in the\nfinal rule) requiring that the wage\ngarnishment order ‘‘indicate a\nreasonable period of time within which\nthe employer is required to commence\nwage withholding’’ because\ngarnishment orders in all other contexts\ntypically require immediate compliance.This suggestion was not incorporated\ninto the final rule.This may vary given\nan employer’s circumstances.NPRM § 285.11(j) Exclusions From\nGarnishment.FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(l) Ending Garnishment\nThe final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that the rule\nclarify whether collection costs need to\nbe collected before terminating the\ngarnishment action.NPRM § 285.11(l),\nunchanged in the final rule, clearly\nrequires termination of garnishment\nonly after the agency ‘‘has fully\nrecovered the amounts owed by the\ndebtor, including interest, penalties and\nadministrative costs consistent with the\nFCCS (Federal Claims Collection\nStandards).’’ See 31 U.S.C.3717(e) and\n4 CFR 102.13 regarding the collection of\nadministrative costs associated with a\ndebt.NPRM § 285.11(m) Actions Prohibited\nby the Employer\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(m).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(n) Refunds\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.However, FMS has amended NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(o) in the final rule to\nincorporate a suggestion by another\ncommenter that the rule be changed to\nclarify that ‘‘termination of the\ncollection action’’ merely refers to the\nparticular debtor/employee, rather than\nthe debt.This change gives agencies\nflexibility to terminate collection action\nagainst one of the debtors and file suit\nagainst that debtor’s employer for failing\nto withhold that debtor’s wages\npursuant to a wage garnishment order.At the same time, the agency could\ncontinue collection efforts involving the\nother debtors who are jointly and\nseverally liable to the agency on the\ndebt.It is hereby\ncertified that this regulation, including\nthe certification referenced in this final\nrule (see paragraph (h) of this section),\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities.Although a substantial number\nof small entities will be subject to this\nregulation and to the certification\nrequirement in this rule, the\nrequirements will not have a significant\neconomic impact on these entities.Employers of delinquent debtors must\ncertify certain information about the\ndebtor such as the debtor’s employment\nstatus and earnings.This information is\ncontained in the employer’s payroll\nrecords.Therefore, it will not take a\nsignificant amount of time or result in\na significant cost for an employer to\ncomplete the certification form.Even if\nan employer is served withholding\norders on several employees over the\ncourse of a year, the cost imposed on the\nemployer to complete the certifications\nwould not have a significant economic\nimpact on that entity.List

321,\n3701, 3711, 3716, 3720A, 3720D; E.O.13019;\n3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 216. 2.Section 285.11 is added to Subpart\n\nB to read as follows:\n\n§ 285.11 Administrative wage\ngarnishment. (a) Purpose.(2) This section shall apply\n\nnotwithstanding any provision of State\nlaw.(3) Nothing in this section precludes\n\nthe compromise of a debt or the\nsuspension or termination of collection\naction in accordance with applicable\nlaw.(4) The receipt of payments pursuant\n\nto this section does not preclude a\nFederal agency from pursuing other debt\ncollection remedies, including the offset\nof Federal payments to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.A Federal agency may\npursue such debt collection remedies\nseparately or in conjunction with\nadministrative wage garnishment.(5) This section does not apply to the\n\ncollection of delinquent nontax debt\nowed to the United States from the\nwages of Federal employees from their\nFederal employment.Federal pay is\nsubject to the Federal salary offset\nprocedures set forth in 5 U.S.C.5514\nand other applicable laws.For purposes\nof this section, agency means either the\nagency that administers the program\nthat gave rise to the debt or the agency\nthat pursues recovery of the debt.Business day means Monday through\n\nFriday.Certificate of service means a\n\ncertificate signed by an agency official\nindicating the nature of the document to\nwhich it pertains, the date of mailing of\nthe document, and to whom the\ndocument is being sent.Day means calendar day.

(e) Notice requirements.(1) At least 30\ndays before the initiation of garnishment\nproceedings, the agency shall mail, by\nfirst class mail, to the debtor’s last\nknown address a written notice\ninforming the debtor of:\n\n(i) The nature and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The intention of the agency to\ninitiate proceedings to collect the debt\nthrough deductions from pay until the\ndebt and all accumulated interest,\npenalties and administrative costs are\npaid in full; and\n\n(iii) An explanation of the debtor’s\n\nrights, including those set forth in\nparagraph (e)(2) of this section, and the\ntime frame within which the debtor may\nexercise his or her rights.(2) The debtor shall be afforded the\n\nopportunity:\n\n(i) To inspect and copy agency\n\nrecords related to the debt;\n\n(ii) To enter into a written repayment\nagreement with the agency under terms\nagreeable to the agency; and\n\n(iii) For a hearing in accordance with\nparagraph (f) of this section concerning\nthe existence or the amount of the debt\nor the terms of the proposed repayment\nschedule under the garnishment order.However, the debtor is not entitled to a\nhearing concerning the terms of the\nproposed repayment schedule if these\nterms have been established by written\nagreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of\nthis section.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes. (f) Hearing—(1) In general.Agencies\n\nshall prescribe regulations for the\nconduct of administrative wage\ngarnishment hearings consistent with\nthis section or shall adopt this section\nwithout change by reference. (2) Request for hearing.The agency\nshall provide a hearing, which at the\nagency’s option may be oral or written,\nif the debtor submits a written request\nfor a hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt or the terms of the\nrepayment schedule (for repayment\nschedules established other than by\nwritten agreement under paragraph\n(e)(2)(ii)) of this section.(3) Type of hearing or review.(i) For\npurposes of this section, whenever an\nagency is required to afford a debtor a\nhearing, the agency shall provide the\ndebtor with a reasonable opportunity for\nan oral hearing when the agency\ndetermines that the issues in dispute\ncannot be resolved by review of the\ndocumentary evidence, for example,\nwhen the validity of the claim turns on\nthe issue of credibility or veracity.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25141\n\nexpenses incurred by the debtor in\nconnection with an in-person hearing\nwill be borne by the debtor.All\ntelephonic charges incurred during the\nhearing will be the responsibility of the\nagency.If the debtor’s written request is\nreceived by the agency after the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall provide\na hearing to the debtor.(8) Burden of proof. (i) The agency\nwill have the burden of going forward\nto prove the existence or amount of the\ndebt.(ii) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes\nthe existence or amount of the debt, the\ndebtor must present by a preponderance\nof the evidence that no debt exists or\nthat the amount of the debt is incorrect.In addition, the debtor may present\nevidence that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule are unlawful,\nwould cause a financial hardship to the\n\ndebtor, or that collection of the debt\nmay not be pursued due to operation of\nlaw.(9) Record. The hearing official must\n\nmaintain a summary record of any\nhearing provided under this section.A\nhearing is not required to be a formal\nevidentiary-type hearing, however,\nwitnesses who testify in oral hearings\nwill do so under oath or affirmation. (10) Date of decision.The hearing\nofficial shall issue a written opinion\nstating his or her decision, as soon as\npracticable, but not later than sixty (60)\ndays after the date on which the request\nfor such hearing was received by the\nagency.If an agency is unable to provide\nthe debtor with a hearing and render a\ndecision within 60 days after the receipt\nof the request for such hearing:\n\n(i) The agency may not issue a\n\nwithholding order until the hearing is\nheld and a decision rendered; or\n\n(ii) If the agency had previously\nissued a withholding order to the\ndebtor’s employer, the agency must\nsuspend the withholding order\nbeginning on the 61st day after the\nreceipt of the hearing request and\ncontinuing until a hearing is held and\na decision is rendered.(11) Content of decision. The written\n\ndecision shall include:\n\n(i) A summary of the facts presented;\n(ii) The hearing official’s findings,\n\nanalysis and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment\n\nschedules, if applicable.(12) Final agency action. The hearing\n\nofficial’s decision will be the final\nagency action for the purposes of\njudicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.701 et seq.). (13) Failure to appear.In the absence\nof good cause shown, a debtor who fails\nto appear at a hearing scheduled\npursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this\nsection will be deemed as not having\ntimely filed a request for a hearing. (g) Wage garnishment order.(2) The withholding order sent to the\nemployer under paragraph (g)(1) of this\nsection shall be in a form prescribed by\nthe Secretary of the Treasury on the\n\nagency’s letterhead and signed by the\nhead of the agency or his/her delegatee.The order shall contain only the\ninformation necessary for the employer\nto comply with the withholding order.Such information includes the debtor’s\nname, address, and social security\nnumber, as well as instructions for\nwithholding and information as to\nwhere payments should be sent.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes.(h) Certification by employer.Along\nwith the withholding order, the agency\nshall send to the employer a\ncertification in a form prescribed by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The employer\nshall complete and return the\ncertification to the agency within the\ntime frame prescribed in the\ninstructions to the form.The\ncertification will address matters such\nas information about the debtor’s\nemployment status and disposable pay\navailable for withholding. (i) Amounts withheld.(1) After receipt\n\nof the garnishment order issued under\nthis section, the employer shall deduct\nfrom all disposable pay paid to the\napplicable debtor during each pay\nperiod the amount of garnishment\ndescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this\nsection.(2)(i) Subject to the provisions of\n\nparagraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this\nsection, the amount of garnishment\nshall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay; or\n\n(B) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment).The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a\ndebtor’s disposable pay exceeds an\namount equivalent to thirty times the\nminimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.(3) When a debtor’s pay is subject to\n\nwithholding orders with priority the\nfollowing shall apply:\n\n(i) Unless otherwise provided by\nFederal law, withholding orders issued\nunder this section shall be paid in the\namounts set forth under paragraph (i)(2)\nof this section and shall have priority\nover other withholding orders which are\nserved later in time.Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, withholding orders for\nfamily support shall have priority over\nwithholding orders issued under this\nsection.(ii) If amounts are being withheld\n\nfrom a debtor’s pay pursuant to a\nwithholding order served on an\nemployer before a withholding order\n\n\f25142\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nissued pursuant to this section, or if a\nwithholding order for family support is\nserved on an employer at any time, the\namounts withheld pursuant to the\nwithholding order issued under this\nsection shall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under\n\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of the\n\ndebtor’s disposable pay less the\namount(s) withheld under the\nwithholding order(s) with priority.(iii) If a debtor owes more than one\ndebt to an agency, the agency may issue\nmultiple withholding orders provided\nthat the total amount garnished from the\ndebtor’s pay for such orders does not\nexceed the amount set forth in\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section.For\npurposes of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the\nterm agency refers to the agency that is\nowed the debt.(4) An amount greater than that set\nforth in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of\nthis section may be withheld upon the\nwritten consent of debtor.(5) The employer shall promptly pay\n\nto the agency all amounts withheld in\naccordance with the withholding order\nissued pursuant to this section.(6) An employer shall not be required\nto vary its normal pay and disbursement\ncycles in order to comply with the\nwithholding order.(8) The employer shall withhold the\nappropriate amount from the debtor’s\nwages for each pay period until the\nemployer receives notification from the\nagency to discontinue wage\nwithholding.The garnishment order\nshall indicate a reasonable period of\n\ntime within which the employer is\nrequired to commence wage\nwithholding.(j) Exclusions from garnishment.The debtor has the burden of\ninforming the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. (k) Financial hardship.(1) A debtor\n\nwhose wages are subject to a wage\nwithholding order under this section,\nmay, at any time, request a review by\nthe agency of the amount garnished,\nbased on materially changed\ncircumstances such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness which\nresult in financial hardship.(2) A debtor requesting a review\nunder paragraph (k)(1) of this section\nshall submit the basis for claiming that\nthe current amount of garnishment\nresults in a financial hardship to the\ndebtor, along with supporting\ndocumentation.Agencies shall consider\nany information submitted in\naccordance with procedures and\nstandards established by the agency.(3) If a financial hardship is found,\nthe agency shall downwardly adjust, by\nan amount and for a period of time\nagreeable to the agency, the amount\ngarnished to reflect the debtor’s\nfinancial condition.The agency will\nnotify the employer of any adjustments\nto the amounts to be withheld. (l) Ending garnishment.(1) Once the\nagency has fully recovered the amounts\nowed by the debtor, including interest,\npenalties, and administrative costs\nconsistent with the FCCS, the agency\nshall send the debtor’s employer\nnotification to discontinue wage\nwithholding.(2) At least annually, an agency shall\n\nreview its debtors’ accounts to ensure\nthat garnishment has been terminated\nfor accounts that have been paid in full.(m) Actions prohibited by the\nemployer.An employer may not\ndischarge, refuse to employ, or take\ndisciplinary action against the debtor\ndue to the issuance of a withholding\norder under this section. (n) Refunds.(1) If a hearing official, at\n\na hearing held pursuant to paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section, determines that a\ndebt is not legally due and owing to the\nUnited States, the agency shall promptly\nrefund any amount collected by means\nof administrative wage garnishment.(2) Unless required by Federal law or\n\ncontract, refunds under this section\nshall not bear interest. (o) Right of action.The agency may\nsue any employer for any amount that\nthe employer fails to withhold from\nwages owed and payable to an employee\nin accordance with paragraphs (g) and\n(i) of this section.However, a suit may\nnot be filed before the termination of the\ncollection action involving a particular\ndebtor, unless earlier filing is necessary\nto avoid expiration of any applicable\nstatute of limitations period.For\npurposes of this section, ‘‘termination of\nthe collection action’’ occurs when the\nagency has terminated collection action\nin accordance with the FCCS or other\napplicable standards.In any event,\ntermination of the collection action will\nhave been deemed to occur if the agency\nhas not received any payments to satisfy\nthe debt from the particular debtor\nwhose wages were subject to\ngarnishment, in whole or in part, for a\nperiod of one (1) year.98–11966 Filed 5–5–98; 8:45 am]\n\nBILLING  CODE  4810–35–P",

      "question": "How does the rule address employer responsibilities regarding wage garnishment?",
      "answer": "1. The agency will send to the employer of a delinquent debtor a wage garnishment order directing that the employer pay a portion of the debtor’s wages to the Federal Government.\n2. This final rule requires the debtor’s employer to certify certain payment information about the debtor.\n3. Employers will not be required to vary their normal pay cycles in order to comply with the garnishment order.\n4. The DCIA prohibits employers from taking disciplinary actions against the debtor based on the fact that the debtor’s wages are subject to administrative garnishment.\n5. The DCIA authorizes an agency to sue an employer for amounts not properly withheld from the wages payable to the debtor.",

          "provenance": "The Financial\nManagement Service (FMS), a bureau of\nthe Department of the Treasury, is\nresponsible for promulgating the\nregulations implementing this and other\ndebt collection tools established by the\nDCIA.In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.The DCIA prohibits employers from\ntaking disciplinary actions against the\ndebtor based on the fact that the debtor’s\nwages are subject to administrative\ngarnishment.Discussion of Comments\n\nGeneral\n\nIn response to its Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking (NPRM) concerning\nAdministrative Wage Garnishment (62\nFR 62458, Nov. 21, 1997), FMS received\ncomments from Federal agencies,\nprivate collection agencies, an umbrella\norganization for organizations that\nsupport the activities of the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Programs, and a\nprivate citizen.The DCIA wage garnishment\nprovision and this rule, on the other\nhand, are applicable to all Federal\nagencies collecting all types of debt, the\ncollection of which is subject to a\nvariety of statutory provisions.Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(b) Scope\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\nincorrectly interpreted the DCIA in the\nNPRM by not limiting the applicability\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25137\n\nof administrative wage garnishment to\nthe collection of only those debts\nevidenced by written agreements.The\ncommenter believes that the language\ncontained in 31 U.S.C.3720D(a)\nauthorizing wage garnishment ‘‘if the\nindividual is not currently making\nrequired repayment in accordance with\nany agreement between the agency head\nand the individual’’ so limits the use of\nwage garnishment.FMS disagrees with\nthe commenter.The term ‘‘debt,’’ as defined in 31 U.S.C.3701(b)(1), as amended by the DCIA, is\nnot limited to debts evidenced by a\nwritten agreement between the debtor\nand the Government.One commenter suggested that the\nrule establish a minimum threshold\namount for garnishment based on a cost\nestimate of the garnishment procedure.Agencies may set their own\npolicies regarding minimum thresholds.NPRM § 285.11(c) Definitions\n\nOne commenter suggested that the\n\ndefinition of agency under NPRM\n§ 285.11(c) be expanded to authorize\nagents or vendors of Federal agencies to\ngarnish debtors’ wages in accordance\nwith this rule.Whether or not an agent\nor vendor can perform a particular\nfunction on behalf of a Federal agency\nis beyond the scope of this rule.While\nthe use of contractors for the collection\nof debt generally is authorized by law,\nagencies may not contract out\n‘‘inherently governmental functions.’’\nSee Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) Circular A–76.This is not to say\nthat contractors cannot assist agencies\nin conducting administrative wage\ngarnishment.For example, contractors\ncould be hired to mail notices and\ngarnishment orders authorized by the\nagency, receive documents from the\ndebtor and the employer, and document\nagency-approved repayment agreements\nwith the debtor.NPRM § 285.11(d) General Rule\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\n\nclarify a statement in the NPRM\npreamble concerning NPRM § 285.11(d)\ninvolving the use of wage garnishment\nby Treasury-designated debt collection\ncenters.In addition to agencies that\nadminister the program that gives rise to\nthe debt, agencies that pursue the\nrecovery of the debt for those agencies,\nsuch as the Department of the Treasury,\n\nTreasury-designated debt collection\ncenters, and the Department of Justice,\nare authorized to conduct\nadministrative wage garnishment.See,\ne.g., the definition of ‘‘agency’’ in NPRM\n§ 285.11(c), unchanged in the final rule.The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.In\nmany circumstances, the debtor can be\ninformed clearly in a single\ncommunication of all debt collection\nremedies available to the Federal agency\nand the opportunities available to the\ndebtor to be heard concerning the\nexistence or amount of the debt.One commenter’s suggestion that FMS\ndevelop a standard administrative wage\ngarnishment notice for government-\nwide use has not been incorporated in\nthe final rule.Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.1692 et seq.,\nprovided that such entities comply with\nthe terms of this rule and use notices\nand forms developed by Treasury or\nother agencies.The extent to which the\nFDCPA may apply to any entity,\nparticularly private collection agencies,\nis outside the scope of this rule.Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.Other commenters\nsuggested that a certificate of service is\nunnecessary.The final rule retains the\nrequirement that an agency keep a\ncertificate of service as evidence of\nmailing.However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.Another\ncommenter questioned how an agency’s\n\nexisting hearing procedures for debt\ndetermination relate to the wage\ngarnishment requirements contained in\nthe DCIA and NPRM.The phrase\n‘‘consistent with this section’’ was\nadded to NPRM § 285.11(f)(1) in this\nfinal rule to clarify that agency\nregulations must follow the minimum\nrequirements for wage garnishment\nhearings as set forth in this rule.Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.Those agencies with hearings\nprocedures which meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand agency-specific statutory and other\nrequirements need not develop new\nhearing procedures.Agencies should\nseek legal advice from their agency\ncounsel to determine whether existing\nagency procedures meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand whether the agency is required to\npublish new or amended regulations.Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.FMS was concerned that 15 calendar\ndays would not allow sufficient time for\na debtor to request a hearing prior to the\nissuance of a garnishment order given\nthat 15 calendar days could include four\nto seven weekend days or holidays.For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.Several comments addressed the\nhearing procedures proposed in the\nNPRM.The final rule incorporates the\ncomment from two commenters\n\n\f25138\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nsuggesting that the requirement in\nNPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) that a debtor\nprove by ‘‘clear and convincing\nevidence’’ that no debt exists or that the\namount of the debt is incorrect is too\nburdensome.In the final rule at\n§ 285.11(f)(8)(ii), FMS replaced the\n‘‘clear and convincing’’ standard with\nthe less burdensome ‘‘preponderance of\nthe evidence’’ standard.One commenter suggested that\nproving the terms of the repayment\nschedule are ‘‘unreasonable,’’ as\nrequired at NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii), is\ntoo vague and that the debtor should be\nrequired to show that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule would cause a\n‘‘financial hardship’’ to the debtor.The\nfinal rule incorporates this suggestion.In response to a commenter’s\n\nsuggestion, NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the debtor\nmay present evidence that collection of\nthe debt may not be pursued due to\noperation of law, e.g., enforcement of\nthe order is subject to the automatic stay\nimposed at the time of a bankruptcy\nfiling pursuant to 11 U.S.C.362. Two commenters suggested that this\n\nrule restrict hearing officials to those\nindividuals not under the supervision or\ncontrol of the head of the agency.The\ncommenters suggested that the rule,\nwithout such a change, could result in\ninequitable wage garnishment hearing\ndecisions since an agency, and its\nqualified hearing officer, have a vested\ninterest in the outcome.FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.Unlike other statutes,\nsee, e.g., 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.Second, the rule explicitly sets forth\nminimum hearing procedures that\nensure the debtor has a meaningful\nopportunity to be heard and minimize\nthe risk of erroneous deprivation of the\ndebtor’s property interest in his or her\nwages.Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 706 (concerning\njudicial review of an agency’s actions).NPRM § 285.11(g) Wage Garnishment\nOrder\n\nOne commenter noted that the\nprovision under NPRM § 285.11(g)\nrequiring agencies to submit a wage\ngarnishment order to a debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days of a hearing\ndecision (or within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing) should be reconciled with the\n20 day period provided under\nEducation’s wage garnishment\n\nregulation at 34 CFR 682.410(b)(10)(H).Such a reconciliation with Education’s\nrule is not warranted or necessary.The\ntime period in this rule accommodates\na broad range of agencies’ requirements\nand is consistent with the goal of\nissuing a wage garnishment order\npromptly after notice and an\nopportunity to be heard have been\nprovided to the debtor.The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.Failure to include a signature on\na wage withholding order could result\nin employer uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the order and could result in\ndelay, and possible loss, of garnishment\npayments to which the Government is\nentitled.As noted in the NPRM and as\nsuggested by a commenter, FMS is\ndeveloping a wage garnishment order\nform.It is anticipated that the use of a\nstandard wage garnishment order form\nby agencies will make it easier for\nprivate sector employers to recognize\nand comply with agency wage\ngarnishment order requirements.This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.Nelson\nv. Diversified Collection Services, 961\nF.Supp. 863, 868–69 (D. Md. 1997).By\nrequiring an agency to retain a copy of\nthe certificate of service, the agency can\nproduce evidence that the order was\nmailed without having to place an\nadditional burden on the employer.One commenter suggested that the\nrequirement to comply with the wage\ngarnishment order should be waived\nunder circumstances when a small\n\nemployer (with less than five\nemployees) would be subject to a major\nhardship (financial or otherwise) as a\nresult of complying with the order.Such\na change to the rule is unnecessary since\nthe use of the wage garnishment\ncollection tool by agencies is not\nmandated under the DCIA.Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.",

SUMMARY: This final rule implements\nthe administrative wage garnishment\nprovisions contained in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996\n(DCIA).Wage garnishment is a process\nwhereby an employer withholds\namounts from an employee’s wages and\npays those amounts to the employee’s\ncreditor in satisfaction of a withholding\norder.The DCIA authorizes Federal\nagencies administratively to garnish the\ndisposable pay of an individual to\ncollect delinquent nontax debts owed to\nthe United States in accordance with\nregulations issued by the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.DATES: This rule is effective June 5,\n1998.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nGerry Isenberg, Financial Program\nSpecialist, Debt Management Services,\nat (202) 874–6660 or James Regan,\nAttorney-Advisor, at (202) 874–6680,\nFinancial Management Service,\nDepartment of the Treasury, 401 14th\nStreet SW, Washington, DC 20227.This\ndocument is available for downloading\nfrom the Financial Management Service\nweb site at the following address: http:/\n/www.fms.treas.gov.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\nThis final rule implements the wage\n\ngarnishment provision in section\n31001(o) of the Debt Collection\nImprovement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Pub.L. 104–134, 110 Stat. 1321–358 (Apr.26,\n1996), codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D.Wage garnishment is a process whereby\nan employer withholds amounts from\nan employee’s wages and pays those\namounts to the employee’s creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.The\nDCIA authorizes Federal agencies\nadministratively to garnish up to 15% of\nthe disposable pay of a debtor to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.Prior to the enactment of\nthe DCIA, agencies were required to\nobtain a court judgment before\ngarnishing the wages of non-Federal\nemployees.Section 31001(o) of the\nDCIA preempts State laws that prohibit\nwage garnishment or otherwise govern\nwage garnishment procedures.As authorized by the DCIA, a Federal\n\nagency collecting delinquent nontax\ndebt may garnish administratively a\ndelinquent debtor’s wages in accordance\nwith regulations promulgated by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The Financial\nManagement Service (FMS), a bureau of\nthe Department of the Treasury, is\nresponsible for promulgating the\nregulations implementing this and other\ndebt collection tools established by the\nDCIA.In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.2. Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.For hearing requests\nthat are not received in the specified\ntime frame, an agency need not delay\nissuance of the withholding order prior\nto conducting a hearing.An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.The debtor bears the\nburden of informing the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. 3.Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.The DCIA prohibits employers from\ntaking disciplinary actions against the\ndebtor based on the fact that the debtor’s\nwages are subject to administrative\ngarnishment.In addition, the DCIA\n\nauthorizes an agency to sue an employer\nfor amounts not properly withheld from\nthe wages payable to the debtor.Discussion of Comments\n\nGeneral\n\nIn response to its Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking (NPRM) concerning\nAdministrative Wage Garnishment (62\nFR 62458, Nov. 21, 1997), FMS received\ncomments from Federal agencies,\nprivate collection agencies, an umbrella\norganization for organizations that\nsupport the activities of the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Programs, and a\nprivate citizen.Many of the commenters\nhave been involved in implementing a\nsimilar administrative wage\ngarnishment provision that authorizes\nthe U.S. Department of Education\n(Education) to garnish 10% of the\ndisposable pay of employed individuals\nwho have defaulted on their student\nloan obligations.See 20 U.S.C. 1095a;\n34 CFR 682.410.FMS drafted the NPRM\nafter consultation with the Departments\nof Education and Justice about their\nexperience implementing wage\ngarnishment to collect student loans.The comments received in response to\nthe NPRM based on the commenters’\nexperience with Education’s program\nhave been helpful in drafting the final\nrule.It is important to note that\nEducation’s wage garnishment program\nis applicable to the collection of one\ntype of debt subject to a single statutory\nscheme.The DCIA wage garnishment\nprovision and this rule, on the other\nhand, are applicable to all Federal\nagencies collecting all types of debt, the\ncollection of which is subject to a\nvariety of statutory provisions.Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(b) Scope\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\nincorrectly interpreted the DCIA in the\nNPRM by not limiting the applicability\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25137\n\nof administrative wage garnishment to\nthe collection of only those debts\nevidenced by written agreements.The\ncommenter believes that the language\ncontained in 31 U.S.C.3720D(a)\nauthorizing wage garnishment ‘‘if the\nindividual is not currently making\nrequired repayment in accordance with\nany agreement between the agency head\nand the individual’’ so limits the use of\nwage garnishment.FMS disagrees with\nthe commenter.There is nothing in the\nplain language of the statute to indicate\nthat the referenced phrase limits the\napplicability of wage garnishment to\ndebts evidenced by a written agreement.The term ‘‘debt,’’ as defined in 31 U.S.C.3701(b)(1), as amended by the DCIA, is\nnot limited to debts evidenced by a\nwritten agreement between the debtor\nand the Government.One commenter suggested that the\nrule establish a minimum threshold\namount for garnishment based on a cost\nestimate of the garnishment procedure.This is unnecessary since the use of the\nadministrative wage garnishment tool\nby agencies is voluntary and should be\nused by agencies in appropriate\nsituations.Agencies may set their own\npolicies regarding minimum thresholds.NPRM § 285.11(c) Definitions\n\nOne commenter suggested that the\n\ndefinition of agency under NPRM\n§ 285.11(c) be expanded to authorize\nagents or vendors of Federal agencies to\ngarnish debtors’ wages in accordance\nwith this rule.Whether or not an agent\nor vendor can perform a particular\nfunction on behalf of a Federal agency\nis beyond the scope of this rule.While\nthe use of contractors for the collection\nof debt generally is authorized by law,\nagencies may not contract out\n‘‘inherently governmental functions.’’\nSee Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) Circular A–76.This is not to say\nthat contractors cannot assist agencies\nin conducting administrative wage\ngarnishment.For example, contractors\ncould be hired to mail notices and\ngarnishment orders authorized by the\nagency, receive documents from the\ndebtor and the employer, and document\nagency-approved repayment agreements\nwith the debtor.NPRM § 285.11(d) General Rule\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\n\nclarify a statement in the NPRM\npreamble concerning NPRM § 285.11(d)\ninvolving the use of wage garnishment\nby Treasury-designated debt collection\ncenters.In addition to agencies that\nadminister the program that gives rise to\nthe debt, agencies that pursue the\nrecovery of the debt for those agencies,\nsuch as the Department of the Treasury,\n\nTreasury-designated debt collection\ncenters, and the Department of Justice,\nare authorized to conduct\nadministrative wage garnishment.See,\ne.g., the definition of ‘‘agency’’ in NPRM\n§ 285.11(c), unchanged in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(e) Notice\nRequirements\n\nThe suggestion by one commenter\nthat the rule specifically prohibit the\ncombination of an agency’s notice of\nintention to garnish a debtor’s wages\nwith other notices to the debtor has not\nbeen incorporated into this rule.The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.In\nmany circumstances, the debtor can be\ninformed clearly in a single\ncommunication of all debt collection\nremedies available to the Federal agency\nand the opportunities available to the\ndebtor to be heard concerning the\nexistence or amount of the debt.One commenter’s suggestion that FMS\ndevelop a standard administrative wage\ngarnishment notice for government-\nwide use has not been incorporated in\nthe final rule.Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.1692 et seq.,\nprovided that such entities comply with\nthe terms of this rule and use notices\nand forms developed by Treasury or\nother agencies.The extent to which the\nFDCPA may apply to any entity,\nparticularly private collection agencies,\nis outside the scope of this rule.Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.Other commenters\nsuggested that a certificate of service is\nunnecessary.The final rule retains the\nrequirement that an agency keep a\ncertificate of service as evidence of\nmailing.However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.Another\ncommenter questioned how an agency’s\n\nexisting hearing procedures for debt\ndetermination relate to the wage\ngarnishment requirements contained in\nthe DCIA and NPRM.The phrase\n‘‘consistent with this section’’ was\nadded to NPRM § 285.11(f)(1) in this\nfinal rule to clarify that agency\nregulations must follow the minimum\nrequirements for wage garnishment\nhearings as set forth in this rule.Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.Those agencies with hearings\nprocedures which meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand agency-specific statutory and other\nrequirements need not develop new\nhearing procedures.Agencies should\nseek legal advice from their agency\ncounsel to determine whether existing\nagency procedures meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand whether the agency is required to\npublish new or amended regulations.Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.One commenter recommended\namending NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) by\nestablishing that a debtor has 15\n‘‘calendar’’ days, rather than 15\n‘‘business’’ days, to request a hearing.FMS was concerned that 15 calendar\ndays would not allow sufficient time for\na debtor to request a hearing prior to the\nissuance of a garnishment order given\nthat 15 calendar days could include four\nto seven weekend days or holidays.For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.Several comments addressed the\nhearing procedures proposed in the\nNPRM.The final rule incorporates the\ncomment from two commenters\n\n\f25138\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nsuggesting that the requirement in\nNPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) that a debtor\nprove by ‘‘clear and convincing\nevidence’’ that no debt exists or that the\namount of the debt is incorrect is too\nburdensome.In the final rule at\n§ 285.11(f)(8)(ii), FMS replaced the\n‘‘clear and convincing’’ standard with\nthe less burdensome ‘‘preponderance of\nthe evidence’’ standard.One commenter suggested that\nproving the terms of the repayment\nschedule are ‘‘unreasonable,’’ as\nrequired at NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii), is\ntoo vague and that the debtor should be\nrequired to show that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule would cause a\n‘‘financial hardship’’ to the debtor.The\nfinal rule incorporates this suggestion.In response to a commenter’s\n\nsuggestion, NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the debtor\nmay present evidence that collection of\nthe debt may not be pursued due to\noperation of law, e.g., enforcement of\nthe order is subject to the automatic stay\nimposed at the time of a bankruptcy\nfiling pursuant to 11 U.S.C.362. Two commenters suggested that this\n\nrule restrict hearing officials to those\nindividuals not under the supervision or\ncontrol of the head of the agency.The\ncommenters suggested that the rule,\nwithout such a change, could result in\ninequitable wage garnishment hearing\ndecisions since an agency, and its\nqualified hearing officer, have a vested\ninterest in the outcome.FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.Unlike other statutes,\nsee, e.g., 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.Second, the rule explicitly sets forth\nminimum hearing procedures that\nensure the debtor has a meaningful\nopportunity to be heard and minimize\nthe risk of erroneous deprivation of the\ndebtor’s property interest in his or her\nwages.Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 706 (concerning\njudicial review of an agency’s actions).NPRM § 285.11(g) Wage Garnishment\nOrder\n\nOne commenter noted that the\nprovision under NPRM § 285.11(g)\nrequiring agencies to submit a wage\ngarnishment order to a debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days of a hearing\ndecision (or within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing) should be reconciled with the\n20 day period provided under\nEducation’s wage garnishment\n\nregulation at 34 CFR 682.410(b)(10)(H).Such a reconciliation with Education’s\nrule is not warranted or necessary.The\ntime period in this rule accommodates\na broad range of agencies’ requirements\nand is consistent with the goal of\nissuing a wage garnishment order\npromptly after notice and an\nopportunity to be heard have been\nprovided to the debtor.The final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(g)(2) be amended to delete the\nrequirement that the wage garnishment\norder be signed by the head of the\nagency or his/her designee.The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.Failure to include a signature on\na wage withholding order could result\nin employer uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the order and could result in\ndelay, and possible loss, of garnishment\npayments to which the Government is\nentitled.As noted in the NPRM and as\nsuggested by a commenter, FMS is\ndeveloping a wage garnishment order\nform.It is anticipated that the use of a\nstandard wage garnishment order form\nby agencies will make it easier for\nprivate sector employers to recognize\nand comply with agency wage\ngarnishment order requirements.This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.Nelson\nv. Diversified Collection Services, 961\nF.Supp. 863, 868–69 (D. Md. 1997).By\nrequiring an agency to retain a copy of\nthe certificate of service, the agency can\nproduce evidence that the order was\nmailed without having to place an\nadditional burden on the employer.One commenter suggested that the\nrequirement to comply with the wage\ngarnishment order should be waived\nunder circumstances when a small\n\nemployer (with less than five\nemployees) would be subject to a major\nhardship (financial or otherwise) as a\nresult of complying with the order.Such\na change to the rule is unnecessary since\nthe use of the wage garnishment\ncollection tool by agencies is not\nmandated under the DCIA.Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.NPRM § 285.11(h) Certification by\nEmployer\n\nThe final rule did not incorporate the\nrecommendation of two commenters to\ndelete the requirement under NPRM\n§ 285.11(h) requiring the debtor’s\nemployer to complete and return a\ncertification form to the agency.The\ncommenters suggested this provision is\nunduly burdensome and that an\nemployer’s failure to complete and\nreturn the form could unnecessarily\ndelay the garnishment process.The\ncertification form serves multiple\npurposes.One, the form provides the\nagency with information necessary to\nmonitor the employer’s compliance\nwith the wage garnishment order in\naccordance with the requirements of the\nDCIA and applicable laws.The form\nalso will provide information so the\nagency can calculate anticipated\ncollection amounts to determine\nwhether to pursue other collection tools.Finally, the form will assist the\nemployer in calculating the amount to\nbe garnished from the debtor’s\ndisposable pay.It is noted that the\nemployer’s failure to complete the\ncertification form as required does not\naffect the employer’s responsibility to\nwithhold the appropriate garnishment\namount within a ‘‘reasonable time’’ in\naccordance with this rule.See NPRM\n§ 285.11(i)(7), renumbered as\n§ 285.11(i)(8) in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(i) Amounts Withheld\nTwo commenters recommended\nclarifying the impact of the Consumer\nCredit Protection Act’s (CCPA)\nminimum disposable pay requirement\non the wage garnishment provisions of\nthe DCIA and this rule.See CCPA,\n§ 303(a)(2), codified at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (maximum allowable\ngarnishment).NPRM § 285.11(i) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the amount\nof garnishment is limited by the CCPA.Under section 285.11(i) of the final rule,\nthe amount of garnishment is the lesser\nof the amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay or the amount\nset forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2). The\namount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2)\nis the amount by which a debtor’s\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25139\n\ndisposable pay exceeds an amount\nequivalent to thirty times the minimum\nwage.For example, if a debtor receives\ndisposable pay of $160.00 per week and\nthirty times the minimum wage is\n$154.50, the amount that may be\ngarnished weekly is the lesser of $24.00\n(15% of $160) or $5.50 ($160.00–\n$154.40 = $5.50).See 29 CFR\n870.10(b)(1) for information on\ncalculating an amount equivalent to\nthirty times the minimum wage.Section 285.11(i)(3) of the final rule is\nthe same as NPRM § 285.11(i)(2) except\nthat § 285.11(i)(3)(iii) has been added to\nclarify the amount of garnishment for a\ndebtor who owes multiple debts to a\nsingle creditor agency.Under section\n285(i)(3)(iii) of the final rule, an agency\nmay issue multiple withholding orders\nso long as the total amount garnished\nfrom the debtor’s pay for such orders\ndoes not exceed the garnishment\namount permitted under § 285.11(i)(2).For purposes of § 285.11(i)(3)(iii), the\nterm ‘‘agency’’ refers to the agency that\nis owed the debt.One commenter suggested deleting\n\nthe language in NPRM § 285.11(i)(7)\n(renumbered as § 285.11(i)(8) in the\nfinal rule) requiring that the wage\ngarnishment order ‘‘indicate a\nreasonable period of time within which\nthe employer is required to commence\nwage withholding’’ because\ngarnishment orders in all other contexts\ntypically require immediate compliance.This suggestion was not incorporated\ninto the final rule.The ‘‘reasonable\nperiod of time’’ given to employers\nallows employers adequate time to\ncalculate garnishment withholding\npayroll data involving a debtor\nemployee without disrupting the normal\npayroll cycle.It is anticipated that a\n‘‘reasonable period of time’’ generally\nwill mean that the employer will\ncommence withholdings within two pay\ncycles following receipt of the\ngarnishment order.This may vary given\nan employer’s circumstances.NPRM § 285.11(j) Exclusions From\nGarnishment.No changes were made to the NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(k) Financial Hardship\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(k) be amended further to define\nthe standards for agency review of a\ndebtor’s request for an adjustment in the\namount withheld under a wage\ngarnishment order due to ‘‘financial\nhardship’’ based on ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances.’’ NPRM § 285.11(k),\nunchanged in the final rule, provides\n\nillustrative examples of the type of\nevents which may give rise to financial\nhardship due to ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances,’’ such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness.However, whether financial hardship\nexists must be determined by an\nagency’s review of the particular facts\nand circumstances of a given case.NPRM § 285.11(l) Ending Garnishment\nThe final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that the rule\nclarify whether collection costs need to\nbe collected before terminating the\ngarnishment action.NPRM § 285.11(l),\nunchanged in the final rule, clearly\nrequires termination of garnishment\nonly after the agency ‘‘has fully\nrecovered the amounts owed by the\ndebtor, including interest, penalties and\nadministrative costs consistent with the\nFCCS (Federal Claims Collection\nStandards).’’ See 31 U.S.C.3717(e) and\n4 CFR 102.13 regarding the collection of\nadministrative costs associated with a\ndebt.NPRM § 285.11(m) Actions Prohibited\nby the Employer\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(m).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(n) Refunds\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(o) Right of Action.The final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) be amended to remove the\nrequirement that a Federal agency must\n‘‘terminate collection action’’ as a\nprerequisite to commencing suit against\na debtor’s employer for failure to\nwithhold amounts from wages pursuant\nto a wage garnishment order.The DCIA\nspecifically provides that ‘‘suit (against\nan employer) may not be filed before the\ntermination of the collection action,\nunless earlier filing is necessary to avoid\nexpiration of any applicable statute of\nlimitations period.’’ 31 U.S.C. 3720D(f)(2)(B).However, FMS has amended NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(o) in the final rule to\nincorporate a suggestion by another\ncommenter that the rule be changed to\nclarify that ‘‘termination of the\ncollection action’’ merely refers to the\nparticular debtor/employee, rather than\nthe debt.This change gives agencies\nflexibility to terminate collection action\nagainst one of the debtors and file suit\nagainst that debtor’s employer for failing\nto withhold that debtor’s wages\npursuant to a wage garnishment order.At the same time, the agency could\ncontinue collection efforts involving the\nother debtors who are jointly and\nseverally liable to the agency on the\ndebt.Regulatory Analysis\n\nThis rule is not a significant\nregulatory action as defined in\nExecutive Order 12866.It is hereby\ncertified that this regulation, including\nthe certification referenced in this final\nrule (see paragraph (h) of this section),\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities.Although a substantial number\nof small entities will be subject to this\nregulation and to the certification\nrequirement in this rule, the\nrequirements will not have a significant\neconomic impact on these entities.Employers of delinquent debtors must\ncertify certain information about the\ndebtor such as the debtor’s employment\nstatus and earnings.This information is\ncontained in the employer’s payroll\nrecords.Therefore, it will not take a\nsignificant amount of time or result in\na significant cost for an employer to\ncomplete the certification form.Even if\nan employer is served withholding\norders on several employees over the\ncourse of a year, the cost imposed on the\nemployer to complete the certifications\nwould not have a significant economic\nimpact on that entity.Employers are not\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with a withholding\norder issued pursuant to this rule.List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part

(e) Notice requirements.(1) At least 30\ndays before the initiation of garnishment\nproceedings, the agency shall mail, by\nfirst class mail, to the debtor’s last\nknown address a written notice\ninforming the debtor of:\n\n(i) The nature and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The intention of the agency to\ninitiate proceedings to collect the debt\nthrough deductions from pay until the\ndebt and all accumulated interest,\npenalties and administrative costs are\npaid in full; and\n\n(iii) An explanation of the debtor’s\n\nrights, including those set forth in\nparagraph (e)(2) of this section, and the\ntime frame within which the debtor may\nexercise his or her rights.(2) The debtor shall be afforded the\n\nopportunity:\n\n(i) To inspect and copy agency\n\nrecords related to the debt;\n\n(ii) To enter into a written repayment\nagreement with the agency under terms\nagreeable to the agency; and\n\n(iii) For a hearing in accordance with\nparagraph (f) of this section concerning\nthe existence or the amount of the debt\nor the terms of the proposed repayment\nschedule under the garnishment order.However, the debtor is not entitled to a\nhearing concerning the terms of the\nproposed repayment schedule if these\nterms have been established by written\nagreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of\nthis section.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the notice.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes. (f) Hearing—(1) In general.Agencies\n\nshall prescribe regulations for the\nconduct of administrative wage\ngarnishment hearings consistent with\nthis section or shall adopt this section\nwithout change by reference. (2) Request for hearing.The agency\nshall provide a hearing, which at the\nagency’s option may be oral or written,\nif the debtor submits a written request\nfor a hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt or the terms of the\nrepayment schedule (for repayment\nschedules established other than by\nwritten agreement under paragraph\n(e)(2)(ii)) of this section.(3) Type of hearing or review.(i) For\npurposes of this section, whenever an\nagency is required to afford a debtor a\nhearing, the agency shall provide the\ndebtor with a reasonable opportunity for\nan oral hearing when the agency\ndetermines that the issues in dispute\ncannot be resolved by review of the\ndocumentary evidence, for example,\nwhen the validity of the claim turns on\nthe issue of credibility or veracity.(ii) If the agency determines that an\noral hearing is appropriate, the time and\nlocation of the hearing shall be\nestablished by the agency.An oral\nhearing may, at the debtor’s option, be\nconducted either in-person or by\ntelephone conference.All travel\n\n(c) Definitions. As used in this section\n\nGarnishment means the process of\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25141\n\nexpenses incurred by the debtor in\nconnection with an in-person hearing\nwill be borne by the debtor.All\ntelephonic charges incurred during the\nhearing will be the responsibility of the\nagency.(iii) In those cases when an oral\n\nhearing is not required by this section,\nan agency shall nevertheless accord the\ndebtor a ‘‘paper hearing,’’ that is, an\nagency will decide the issues in dispute\nbased upon a review of the written\nrecord.The agency will establish a\nreasonable deadline for the submission\nof evidence. (4) Effect of timely request.Subject to\n\nparagraph (f)(13) of this section, if the\ndebtor’s written request is received by\nthe agency on or before the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall not\nissue a withholding order under\nparagraph (g) of this section until the\ndebtor has been provided the requested\nhearing and a decision in accordance\nwith paragraphs (f)(10) and (f)(11) of\nthis section has been rendered.(5) Failure to timely request a hearing.If the debtor’s written request is\nreceived by the agency after the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall provide\na hearing to the debtor.However, the\nagency will not delay issuance of a\nwithholding order unless the agency\ndetermines that the delay in filing the\nrequest was caused by factors over\nwhich the debtor had no control, or the\nagency receives information that the\nagency believes justifies a delay or\ncancellation of the withholding order.(6) Hearing official. A hearing official\n\nmay be any qualified individual, as\ndetermined by the head of the agency,\nincluding an administrative law judge. (7) Procedure.After the debtor\n\nrequests a hearing, the hearing official\nshall notify the debtor of:\n\n(i) The date and time of a telephonic\n\nhearing;\n\n(ii) The date, time, and location of an\n\nin-person oral hearing; or\n\n(iii) The deadline for the submission\n\nof evidence for a written hearing.(8) Burden of proof. (i) The agency\nwill have the burden of going forward\nto prove the existence or amount of the\ndebt.(ii) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes\nthe existence or amount of the debt, the\ndebtor must present by a preponderance\nof the evidence that no debt exists or\nthat the amount of the debt is incorrect.In addition, the debtor may present\nevidence that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule are unlawful,\nwould cause a financial hardship to the\n\ndebtor, or that collection of the debt\nmay not be pursued due to operation of\nlaw.(9) Record. The hearing official must\n\nmaintain a summary record of any\nhearing provided under this section.A\nhearing is not required to be a formal\nevidentiary-type hearing, however,\nwitnesses who testify in oral hearings\nwill do so under oath or affirmation. (10) Date of decision.The hearing\nofficial shall issue a written opinion\nstating his or her decision, as soon as\npracticable, but not later than sixty (60)\ndays after the date on which the request\nfor such hearing was received by the\nagency.If an agency is unable to provide\nthe debtor with a hearing and render a\ndecision within 60 days after the receipt\nof the request for such hearing:\n\n(i) The agency may not issue a\n\nwithholding order until the hearing is\nheld and a decision rendered; or\n\n(ii) If the agency had previously\nissued a withholding order to the\ndebtor’s employer, the agency must\nsuspend the withholding order\nbeginning on the 61st day after the\nreceipt of the hearing request and\ncontinuing until a hearing is held and\na decision is rendered.(11) Content of decision. The written\n\ndecision shall include:\n\n(i) A summary of the facts presented;\n(ii) The hearing official’s findings,\n\nanalysis and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment\n\nschedules, if applicable.(12) Final agency action. The hearing\n\nofficial’s decision will be the final\nagency action for the purposes of\njudicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.701 et seq.). (13) Failure to appear.In the absence\nof good cause shown, a debtor who fails\nto appear at a hearing scheduled\npursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this\nsection will be deemed as not having\ntimely filed a request for a hearing. (g) Wage garnishment order.(1)\n\nUnless the agency receives information\nthat the agency believes justifies a delay\nor cancellation of the withholding order,\nthe agency shall send, by first class\nmail, a withholding order to the debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing (i.e., within 15 business days\nafter the mailing of the notice described\nin paragraph (e)(1) of this section), or, if\na timely request for a hearing is made\nby the debtor, within 30 days after a\nfinal decision is made by the agency to\nproceed with garnishment.(2) The withholding order sent to the\nemployer under paragraph (g)(1) of this\nsection shall be in a form prescribed by\nthe Secretary of the Treasury on the\n\nagency’s letterhead and signed by the\nhead of the agency or his/her delegatee.The order shall contain only the\ninformation necessary for the employer\nto comply with the withholding order.Such information includes the debtor’s\nname, address, and social security\nnumber, as well as instructions for\nwithholding and information as to\nwhere payments should be sent.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the order.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes.(h) Certification by employer.Along\nwith the withholding order, the agency\nshall send to the employer a\ncertification in a form prescribed by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The employer\nshall complete and return the\ncertification to the agency within the\ntime frame prescribed in the\ninstructions to the form.The\ncertification will address matters such\nas information about the debtor’s\nemployment status and disposable pay\navailable for withholding. (i) Amounts withheld.(1) After receipt\n\nof the garnishment order issued under\nthis section, the employer shall deduct\nfrom all disposable pay paid to the\napplicable debtor during each pay\nperiod the amount of garnishment\ndescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this\nsection.(2)(i) Subject to the provisions of\n\nparagraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this\nsection, the amount of garnishment\nshall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay; or\n\n(B) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment).The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a\ndebtor’s disposable pay exceeds an\namount equivalent to thirty times the\nminimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.(3) When a debtor’s pay is subject to\n\nwithholding orders with priority the\nfollowing shall apply:\n\n(i) Unless otherwise provided by\nFederal law, withholding orders issued\nunder this section shall be paid in the\namounts set forth under paragraph (i)(2)\nof this section and shall have priority\nover other withholding orders which are\nserved later in time.Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, withholding orders for\nfamily support shall have priority over\nwithholding orders issued under this\nsection.(ii) If amounts are being withheld\n\nfrom a debtor’s pay pursuant to a\nwithholding order served on an\nemployer before a withholding order\n\n\f25142\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nissued pursuant to this section, or if a\nwithholding order for family support is\nserved on an employer at any time, the\namounts withheld pursuant to the\nwithholding order issued under this\nsection shall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under\n\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of the\n\ndebtor’s disposable pay less the\namount(s) withheld under the\nwithholding order(s) with priority.(iii) If a debtor owes more than one\ndebt to an agency, the agency may issue\nmultiple withholding orders provided\nthat the total amount garnished from the\ndebtor’s pay for such orders does not\nexceed the amount set forth in\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section.For\npurposes of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the\nterm agency refers to the agency that is\nowed the debt.(4) An amount greater than that set\nforth in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of\nthis section may be withheld upon the\nwritten consent of debtor.(5) The employer shall promptly pay\n\nto the agency all amounts withheld in\naccordance with the withholding order\nissued pursuant to this section.(6) An employer shall not be required\nto vary its normal pay and disbursement\ncycles in order to comply with the\nwithholding order.(7) Any assignment or allotment by an\n\nemployee of his earnings shall be void\nto the extent it interferes with or\nprohibits execution of the withholding\norder issued under this section, except\nfor any assignment or allotment made\npursuant to a family support judgment\nor order.(8) The employer shall withhold the\nappropriate amount from the debtor’s\nwages for each pay period until the\nemployer receives notification from the\nagency to discontinue wage\nwithholding.The garnishment order\nshall indicate a reasonable period of\n\ntime within which the employer is\nrequired to commence wage\nwithholding.(j) Exclusions from garnishment.The\nagency may not garnish the wages of a\ndebtor who it knows has been\ninvoluntarily separated from\nemployment until the debtor has been\nreemployed continuously for at least 12\nmonths.The debtor has the burden of\ninforming the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. (k) Financial hardship.(1) A debtor\n\nwhose wages are subject to a wage\nwithholding order under this section,\nmay, at any time, request a review by\nthe agency of the amount garnished,\nbased on materially changed\ncircumstances such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness which\nresult in financial hardship.(2) A debtor requesting a review\nunder paragraph (k)(1) of this section\nshall submit the basis for claiming that\nthe current amount of garnishment\nresults in a financial hardship to the\ndebtor, along with supporting\ndocumentation.Agencies shall consider\nany information submitted in\naccordance with procedures and\nstandards established by the agency.(3) If a financial hardship is found,\nthe agency shall downwardly adjust, by\nan amount and for a period of time\nagreeable to the agency, the amount\ngarnished to reflect the debtor’s\nfinancial condition.The agency will\nnotify the employer of any adjustments\nto the amounts to be withheld. (l) Ending garnishment.(1) Once the\nagency has fully recovered the amounts\nowed by the debtor, including interest,\npenalties, and administrative costs\nconsistent with the FCCS, the agency\nshall send the debtor’s employer\nnotification to discontinue wage\nwithholding.(2) At least annually, an agency shall\n\nreview its debtors’ accounts to ensure\nthat garnishment has been terminated\nfor accounts that have been paid in full.(m) Actions prohibited by the\nemployer.An employer may not\ndischarge, refuse to employ, or take\ndisciplinary action against the debtor\ndue to the issuance of a withholding\norder under this section. (n) Refunds.(1) If a hearing official, at\n\na hearing held pursuant to paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section, determines that a\ndebt is not legally due and owing to the\nUnited States, the agency shall promptly\nrefund any amount collected by means\nof administrative wage garnishment.(2) Unless required by Federal law or\n\ncontract, refunds under this section\nshall not bear interest. (o) Right of action.The agency may\nsue any employer for any amount that\nthe employer fails to withhold from\nwages owed and payable to an employee\nin accordance with paragraphs (g) and\n(i) of this section.However, a suit may\nnot be filed before the termination of the\ncollection action involving a particular\ndebtor, unless earlier filing is necessary\nto avoid expiration of any applicable\nstatute of limitations period.For\npurposes of this section, ‘‘termination of\nthe collection action’’ occurs when the\nagency has terminated collection action\nin accordance with the FCCS or other\napplicable standards.In any event,\ntermination of the collection action will\nhave been deemed to occur if the agency\nhas not received any payments to satisfy\nthe debt from the particular debtor\nwhose wages were subject to\ngarnishment, in whole or in part, for a\nperiod of one (1) year.Dated: April 30, 1998.

SUMMARY: This final rule implements\nthe administrative wage garnishment\nprovisions contained in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996\n(DCIA).Wage garnishment is a process\nwhereby an employer withholds\namounts from an employee’s wages and\npays those amounts to the employee’s\ncreditor in satisfaction of a withholding\norder.The DCIA authorizes Federal\nagencies administratively to garnish the\ndisposable pay of an individual to\ncollect delinquent nontax debts owed to\nthe United States in accordance with\nregulations issued by the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.DATES: This rule is effective June 5,\n1998.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nGerry Isenberg, Financial Program\nSpecialist, Debt Management Services,\nat (202) 874–6660 or James Regan,\nAttorney-Advisor, at (202) 874–6680,\nFinancial Management Service,\nDepartment of the Treasury, 401 14th\nStreet SW, Washington, DC 20227.This\ndocument is available for downloading\nfrom the Financial Management Service\nweb site at the following address: http:/\n/www.fms.treas.gov.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\nThis final rule implements the wage\n\ngarnishment provision in section\n31001(o) of the Debt Collection\nImprovement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Pub.L. 104–134, 110 Stat. 1321–358 (Apr.26,\n1996), codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D.Wage garnishment is a process whereby\nan employer withholds amounts from\nan employee’s wages and pays those\namounts to the employee’s creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.Prior to the enactment of\nthe DCIA, agencies were required to\nobtain a court judgment before\ngarnishing the wages of non-Federal\nemployees.Section 31001(o) of the\nDCIA preempts State laws that prohibit\nwage garnishment or otherwise govern\nwage garnishment procedures.As authorized by the DCIA, a Federal\n\nagency collecting delinquent nontax\ndebt may garnish administratively a\ndelinquent debtor’s wages in accordance\nwith regulations promulgated by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.2. Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.For hearing requests\nthat are not received in the specified\ntime frame, an agency need not delay\nissuance of the withholding order prior\nto conducting a hearing.An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.Many of the commenters\nhave been involved in implementing a\nsimilar administrative wage\ngarnishment provision that authorizes\nthe U.S. Department of Education\n(Education) to garnish 10% of the\ndisposable pay of employed individuals\nwho have defaulted on their student\nloan obligations.See 20 U.S.C. 1095a;\n34 CFR 682.410.FMS drafted the NPRM\nafter consultation with the Departments\nof Education and Justice about their\nexperience implementing wage\ngarnishment to collect student loans.The comments received in response to\nthe NPRM based on the commenters’\nexperience with Education’s program\nhave been helpful in drafting the final\nrule.It is important to note that\nEducation’s wage garnishment program\nis applicable to the collection of one\ntype of debt subject to a single statutory\nscheme.The DCIA wage garnishment\nprovision and this rule, on the other\nhand, are applicable to all Federal\nagencies collecting all types of debt, the\ncollection of which is subject to a\nvariety of statutory provisions.Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25137\n\nof administrative wage garnishment to\nthe collection of only those debts\nevidenced by written agreements.The\ncommenter believes that the language\ncontained in 31 U.S.C.3720D(a)\nauthorizing wage garnishment ‘‘if the\nindividual is not currently making\nrequired repayment in accordance with\nany agreement between the agency head\nand the individual’’ so limits the use of\nwage garnishment.FMS disagrees with\nthe commenter.There is nothing in the\nplain language of the statute to indicate\nthat the referenced phrase limits the\napplicability of wage garnishment to\ndebts evidenced by a written agreement.The term ‘‘debt,’’ as defined in 31 U.S.C.3701(b)(1), as amended by the DCIA, is\nnot limited to debts evidenced by a\nwritten agreement between the debtor\nand the Government.One commenter suggested that the\nrule establish a minimum threshold\namount for garnishment based on a cost\nestimate of the garnishment procedure.This is unnecessary since the use of the\nadministrative wage garnishment tool\nby agencies is voluntary and should be\nused by agencies in appropriate\nsituations.Agencies may set their own\npolicies regarding minimum thresholds.NPRM § 285.11(c) Definitions\n\nOne commenter suggested that the\n\ndefinition of agency under NPRM\n§ 285.11(c) be expanded to authorize\nagents or vendors of Federal agencies to\ngarnish debtors’ wages in accordance\nwith this rule.Whether or not an agent\nor vendor can perform a particular\nfunction on behalf of a Federal agency\nis beyond the scope of this rule.While\nthe use of contractors for the collection\nof debt generally is authorized by law,\nagencies may not contract out\n‘‘inherently governmental functions.’’\nSee Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) Circular A–76.This is not to say\nthat contractors cannot assist agencies\nin conducting administrative wage\ngarnishment.For example, contractors\ncould be hired to mail notices and\ngarnishment orders authorized by the\nagency, receive documents from the\ndebtor and the employer, and document\nagency-approved repayment agreements\nwith the debtor.NPRM § 285.11(d) General Rule\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\n\nclarify a statement in the NPRM\npreamble concerning NPRM § 285.11(d)\ninvolving the use of wage garnishment\nby Treasury-designated debt collection\ncenters.See,\ne.g., the definition of ‘‘agency’’ in NPRM\n§ 285.11(c), unchanged in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(e) Notice\nRequirements\n\nThe suggestion by one commenter\nthat the rule specifically prohibit the\ncombination of an agency’s notice of\nintention to garnish a debtor’s wages\nwith other notices to the debtor has not\nbeen incorporated into this rule.The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.In\nmany circumstances, the debtor can be\ninformed clearly in a single\ncommunication of all debt collection\nremedies available to the Federal agency\nand the opportunities available to the\ndebtor to be heard concerning the\nexistence or amount of the debt.One commenter’s suggestion that FMS\ndevelop a standard administrative wage\ngarnishment notice for government-\nwide use has not been incorporated in\nthe final rule.Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.1692 et seq.,\nprovided that such entities comply with\nthe terms of this rule and use notices\nand forms developed by Treasury or\nother agencies.The extent to which the\nFDCPA may apply to any entity,\nparticularly private collection agencies,\nis outside the scope of this rule.Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.Other commenters\nsuggested that a certificate of service is\nunnecessary.The final rule retains the\nrequirement that an agency keep a\ncertificate of service as evidence of\nmailing.However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.Another\ncommenter questioned how an agency’s\n\nexisting hearing procedures for debt\ndetermination relate to the wage\ngarnishment requirements contained in\nthe DCIA and NPRM.The phrase\n‘‘consistent with this section’’ was\nadded to NPRM § 285.11(f)(1) in this\nfinal rule to clarify that agency\nregulations must follow the minimum\nrequirements for wage garnishment\nhearings as set forth in this rule.Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.Those agencies with hearings\nprocedures which meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand agency-specific statutory and other\nrequirements need not develop new\nhearing procedures.Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.One commenter recommended\namending NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) by\nestablishing that a debtor has 15\n‘‘calendar’’ days, rather than 15\n‘‘business’’ days, to request a hearing.FMS was concerned that 15 calendar\ndays would not allow sufficient time for\na debtor to request a hearing prior to the\nissuance of a garnishment order given\nthat 15 calendar days could include four\nto seven weekend days or holidays.For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.Several comments addressed the\nhearing procedures proposed in the\nNPRM.The final rule incorporates the\ncomment from two commenters\n\n\f25138\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.In the final rule at\n§ 285.11(f)(8)(ii), FMS replaced the\n‘‘clear and convincing’’ standard with\nthe less burdensome ‘‘preponderance of\nthe evidence’’ standard.One commenter suggested that\nproving the terms of the repayment\nschedule are ‘‘unreasonable,’’ as\nrequired at NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii), is\ntoo vague and that the debtor should be\nrequired to show that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule would cause a\n‘‘financial hardship’’ to the debtor.The\nfinal rule incorporates this suggestion.In response to a commenter’s\n\nsuggestion, NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the debtor\nmay present evidence that collection of\nthe debt may not be pursued due to\noperation of law, e.g., enforcement of\nthe order is subject to the automatic stay\nimposed at the time of a bankruptcy\nfiling pursuant to 11 U.S.C.362. Two commenters suggested that this\n\nrule restrict hearing officials to those\nindividuals not under the supervision or\ncontrol of the head of the agency.The\ncommenters suggested that the rule,\nwithout such a change, could result in\ninequitable wage garnishment hearing\ndecisions since an agency, and its\nqualified hearing officer, have a vested\ninterest in the outcome.FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.Unlike other statutes,\nsee, e.g., 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 706 (concerning\njudicial review of an agency’s actions).NPRM § 285.11(g) Wage Garnishment\nOrder\n\nOne commenter noted that the\nprovision under NPRM § 285.11(g)\nrequiring agencies to submit a wage\ngarnishment order to a debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days of a hearing\ndecision (or within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing) should be reconciled with the\n20 day period provided under\nEducation’s wage garnishment\n\nregulation at 34 CFR 682.410(b)(10)(H).Such a reconciliation with Education’s\nrule is not warranted or necessary.The\ntime period in this rule accommodates\na broad range of agencies’ requirements\nand is consistent with the goal of\nissuing a wage garnishment order\npromptly after notice and an\nopportunity to be heard have been\nprovided to the debtor.The final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(g)(2) be amended to delete the\nrequirement that the wage garnishment\norder be signed by the head of the\nagency or his/her designee.The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.Failure to include a signature on\na wage withholding order could result\nin employer uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the order and could result in\ndelay, and possible loss, of garnishment\npayments to which the Government is\nentitled.As noted in the NPRM and as\nsuggested by a commenter, FMS is\ndeveloping a wage garnishment order\nform.It is anticipated that the use of a\nstandard wage garnishment order form\nby agencies will make it easier for\nprivate sector employers to recognize\nand comply with agency wage\ngarnishment order requirements.This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.Nelson\nv. Diversified Collection Services, 961\nF.Supp. 863, 868–69 (D. Md. 1997).By\nrequiring an agency to retain a copy of\nthe certificate of service, the agency can\nproduce evidence that the order was\nmailed without having to place an\nadditional burden on the employer.One commenter suggested that the\nrequirement to comply with the wage\ngarnishment order should be waived\nunder circumstances when a small\n\nemployer (with less than five\nemployees) would be subject to a major\nhardship (financial or otherwise) as a\nresult of complying with the order.Such\na change to the rule is unnecessary since\nthe use of the wage garnishment\ncollection tool by agencies is not\nmandated under the DCIA.Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.NPRM § 285.11(h) Certification by\nEmployer\n\nThe final rule did not incorporate the\nrecommendation of two commenters to\ndelete the requirement under NPRM\n§ 285.11(h) requiring the debtor’s\nemployer to complete and return a\ncertification form to the agency.The\ncommenters suggested this provision is\nunduly burdensome and that an\nemployer’s failure to complete and\nreturn the form could unnecessarily\ndelay the garnishment process.The\ncertification form serves multiple\npurposes.One, the form provides the\nagency with information necessary to\nmonitor the employer’s compliance\nwith the wage garnishment order in\naccordance with the requirements of the\nDCIA and applicable laws.The form\nalso will provide information so the\nagency can calculate anticipated\ncollection amounts to determine\nwhether to pursue other collection tools.Finally, the form will assist the\nemployer in calculating the amount to\nbe garnished from the debtor’s\ndisposable pay.It is noted that the\nemployer’s failure to complete the\ncertification form as required does not\naffect the employer’s responsibility to\nwithhold the appropriate garnishment\namount within a ‘‘reasonable time’’ in\naccordance with this rule.See NPRM\n§ 285.11(i)(7), renumbered as\n§ 285.11(i)(8) in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(i) Amounts Withheld\nTwo commenters recommended\nclarifying the impact of the Consumer\nCredit Protection Act’s (CCPA)\nminimum disposable pay requirement\non the wage garnishment provisions of\nthe DCIA and this rule.See CCPA,\n§ 303(a)(2), codified at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (maximum allowable\ngarnishment).Under section 285.11(i) of the final rule,\nthe amount of garnishment is the lesser\nof the amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay or the amount\nset forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2). The\namount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2)\nis the amount by which a debtor’s\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25139\n\ndisposable pay exceeds an amount\nequivalent to thirty times the minimum\nwage.For example, if a debtor receives\ndisposable pay of $160.00 per week and\nthirty times the minimum wage is\n$154.50, the amount that may be\ngarnished weekly is the lesser of $24.00\n(15% of $160) or $5.50 ($160.00–\n$154.40 = $5.50).Section 285.11(i)(3) of the final rule is\nthe same as NPRM § 285.11(i)(2) except\nthat § 285.11(i)(3)(iii) has been added to\nclarify the amount of garnishment for a\ndebtor who owes multiple debts to a\nsingle creditor agency.For purposes of § 285.11(i)(3)(iii), the\nterm ‘‘agency’’ refers to the agency that\nis owed the debt.One commenter suggested deleting\n\nthe language in NPRM § 285.11(i)(7)\n(renumbered as § 285.11(i)(8) in the\nfinal rule) requiring that the wage\ngarnishment order ‘‘indicate a\nreasonable period of time within which\nthe employer is required to commence\nwage withholding’’ because\ngarnishment orders in all other contexts\ntypically require immediate compliance.This suggestion was not incorporated\ninto the final rule.The ‘‘reasonable\nperiod of time’’ given to employers\nallows employers adequate time to\ncalculate garnishment withholding\npayroll data involving a debtor\nemployee without disrupting the normal\npayroll cycle.No changes were made to the NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.However, whether financial hardship\nexists must be determined by an\nagency’s review of the particular facts\nand circumstances of a given case.NPRM § 285.11(l) Ending Garnishment\nThe final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that the rule\nclarify whether collection costs need to\nbe collected before terminating the\ngarnishment action.NPRM § 285.11(l),\nunchanged in the final rule, clearly\nrequires termination of garnishment\nonly after the agency ‘‘has fully\nrecovered the amounts owed by the\ndebtor, including interest, penalties and\nadministrative costs consistent with the\nFCCS (Federal Claims Collection\nStandards).’’ See 31 U.S.C.NPRM § 285.11(m) Actions Prohibited\nby the Employer\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(m).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(n) Refunds\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(o) Right of Action.The final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) be amended to remove the\nrequirement that a Federal agency must\n‘‘terminate collection action’’ as a\nprerequisite to commencing suit against\na debtor’s employer for failure to\nwithhold amounts from wages pursuant\nto a wage garnishment order.The DCIA\nspecifically provides that ‘‘suit (against\nan employer) may not be filed before the\ntermination of the collection action,\nunless earlier filing is necessary to avoid\nexpiration of any applicable statute of\nlimitations period.’’ 31 U.S.C. 3720D(f)(2)(B).However, FMS has amended NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(o) in the final rule to\nincorporate a suggestion by another\ncommenter that the rule be changed to\nclarify that ‘‘termination of the\ncollection action’’ merely refers to the\nparticular debtor/employee, rather than\nthe debt.This change gives agencies\nflexibility to terminate collection action\nagainst one of the debtors and file suit\nagainst that debtor’s employer for failing\nto withhold that debtor’s wages\npursuant to a wage garnishment order.Regulatory Analysis\n\nThis rule is not a significant\nregulatory action as defined in\nExecutive Order 12866.It is hereby\ncertified that this regulation, including\nthe certification referenced in this final\nrule (see paragraph (h) of this section),\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities.Employers of delinquent debtors must\ncertify certain information about the\ndebtor such as the debtor’s employment\nstatus and earnings.Even if\nan employer is served withholding\norders on several employees over the\ncourse of a year, the cost imposed on the\nemployer to complete the certifications\nwould not have a significant economic\nimpact on that entity.Employers are not\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with a withholding\norder issued pursuant to this rule.List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 285\n\nAdministrative practice and\n\nprocedure, Claims, Debts, Garnishment\nof wages, Hearing and appeal\nprocedures,

(e) Notice requirements.However, the debtor is not entitled to a\nhearing concerning the terms of the\nproposed repayment schedule if these\nterms have been established by written\nagreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of\nthis section.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the notice.Agencies\n\nshall prescribe regulations for the\nconduct of administrative wage\ngarnishment hearings consistent with\nthis section or shall adopt this section\nwithout change by reference. (2) Request for hearing.(3) Type of hearing or review.(i) For\npurposes of this section, whenever an\nagency is required to afford a debtor a\nhearing, the agency shall provide the\ndebtor with a reasonable opportunity for\nan oral hearing when the agency\ndetermines that the issues in dispute\ncannot be resolved by review of the\ndocumentary evidence, for example,\nwhen the validity of the claim turns on\nthe issue of credibility or veracity.(ii) If the agency determines that an\noral hearing is appropriate, the time and\nlocation of the hearing shall be\nestablished by the agency.An oral\nhearing may, at the debtor’s option, be\nconducted either in-person or by\ntelephone conference.All travel\n\n(c) Definitions. As used in this section\n\nGarnishment means the process of\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25141\n\nexpenses incurred by the debtor in\nconnection with an in-person hearing\nwill be borne by the debtor.All\ntelephonic charges incurred during the\nhearing will be the responsibility of the\nagency.(iii) In those cases when an oral\n\nhearing is not required by this section,\nan agency shall nevertheless accord the\ndebtor a ‘‘paper hearing,’’ that is, an\nagency will decide the issues in dispute\nbased upon a review of the written\nrecord.The agency will establish a\nreasonable deadline for the submission\nof evidence.

A hearing official\n\nmay be any qualified individual, as\ndetermined by the head of the agency,\nincluding an administrative law judge. (7) Procedure.After the debtor\n\nrequests a hearing, the hearing official\nshall notify the debtor of:\n\n(i) The date and time of a telephonic\n\nhearing;\n\n(ii) The date, time, and location of an\n\nin-person oral hearing; or\n\n(iii) The deadline for the submission\n\nof evidence for a written hearing.(8) Burden of proof. (i) The agency\nwill have the burden of going forward\nto prove the existence or amount of the\ndebt.In addition, the debtor may present\nevidence that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule are unlawful,\nwould cause a financial hardship to the\n\ndebtor, or that collection of the debt\nmay not be pursued due to operation of\nlaw.(9) Record. The hearing official must\n\nmaintain a summary record of any\nhearing provided under this section.A\nhearing is not required to be a formal\nevidentiary-type hearing, however,\nwitnesses who testify in oral hearings\nwill do so under oath or affirmation. (10) Date of decision.The hearing\nofficial shall issue a written opinion\nstating his or her decision, as soon as\npracticable, but not later than sixty (60)\ndays after the date on which the request\nfor such hearing was received by the\nagency.If an agency is unable to provide\nthe debtor with a hearing and render a\ndecision within 60 days after the receipt\nof the request for such hearing:\n\n(i) The agency may not issue a\n\nwithholding order until the hearing is\nheld and a decision rendered; or\n\n(ii) If the agency had previously\nissued a withholding order to the\ndebtor’s employer, the agency must\nsuspend the withholding order\nbeginning on the 61st day after the\nreceipt of the hearing request and\ncontinuing until a hearing is held and\na decision is rendered.(11) Content of decision. The written\n\ndecision shall include:\n\n(i) A summary of the facts presented;\n(ii) The hearing official’s findings,\n\nanalysis and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment\n\nschedules, if applicable.(12) Final agency action. The hearing\n\nofficial’s decision will be the final\nagency action for the purposes of\njudicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.In the absence\nof good cause shown, a debtor who fails\nto appear at a hearing scheduled\npursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this\nsection will be deemed as not having\ntimely filed a request for a hearing.

(i) Amounts withheld.(1) After receipt\n\nof the garnishment order issued under\nthis section, the employer shall deduct\nfrom all disposable pay paid to the\napplicable debtor during each pay\nperiod the amount of garnishment\ndescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this\nsection.(2)(i) Subject to the provisions of\n\nparagraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this\nsection, the amount of garnishment\nshall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay; or\n\n(B) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment).The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a\ndebtor’s disposable pay exceeds an\namount equivalent to thirty times the\nminimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, withholding orders for\nfamily support shall have priority over\nwithholding orders issued under this\nsection.(ii) If amounts are being withheld\n\nfrom a debtor’s pay pursuant to a\nwithholding order served on an\nemployer before a withholding order\n\n\f25142\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nissued pursuant to this section, or if a\nwithholding order for family support is\nserved on an employer at any time, the\namounts withheld pursuant to the\nwithholding order issued under this\nsection shall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under\n\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of the\n\ndebtor’s disposable pay less the\namount(s) withheld under the\nwithholding order(s) with priority.(iii) If a debtor owes more than one\ndebt to an agency, the agency may issue\nmultiple withholding orders provided\nthat the total amount garnished from the\ndebtor’s pay for such orders does not\nexceed the amount set forth in\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section.For\npurposes of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the\nterm agency refers to the agency that is\nowed the debt.(5) The employer shall promptly pay\n\nto the agency all amounts withheld in\naccordance with the withholding order\nissued pursuant to this section.(6) An employer shall not be required\nto vary its normal pay and disbursement\ncycles in order to comply with the\nwithholding order.(7) Any assignment or allotment by an\n\nemployee of his earnings shall be void\nto the extent it interferes with or\nprohibits execution of the withholding\norder issued under this section, except\nfor any assignment or allotment made\npursuant to a family support judgment\nor order.The garnishment order\nshall indicate a reasonable period of\n\ntime within which the employer is\nrequired to commence wage\nwithholding.(j) Exclusions from garnishment.The\nagency may not garnish the wages of a\ndebtor who it knows has been\ninvoluntarily separated from\nemployment until the debtor has been\nreemployed continuously for at least 12\nmonths.The debtor has the burden of\ninforming the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. (k) Financial hardship.(1) A debtor\n\nwhose wages are subject to a wage\nwithholding order under this section,\nmay, at any time, request a review by\nthe agency of the amount garnished,\nbased on materially changed\ncircumstances such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness which\nresult in financial hardship.Agencies shall consider\nany information submitted in\naccordance with procedures and\nstandards established by the agency.(3) If a financial hardship is found,\nthe agency shall downwardly adjust, by\nan amount and for a period of time\nagreeable to the agency, the amount\ngarnished to reflect the debtor’s\nfinancial condition.The agency will\nnotify the employer of any adjustments\nto the amounts to be withheld. (l) Ending garnishment.(1) Once the\nagency has fully recovered the amounts\nowed by the debtor, including interest,\npenalties, and administrative costs\nconsistent with the FCCS, the agency\nshall send the debtor’s employer\nnotification to discontinue wage\nwithholding.(2) At least annually, an agency shall\n\nreview its debtors’ accounts to ensure\nthat garnishment has been terminated\nfor accounts that have been paid in full.(m) Actions prohibited by the\nemployer.An employer may not\ndischarge, refuse to employ, or take\ndisciplinary action against the debtor\ndue to the issuance of a withholding\norder under this section. (n) Refunds.(1) If a hearing official, at\n\na hearing held pursuant to paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section, determines that a\ndebt is not legally due and owing to the\nUnited States, the agency shall promptly\nrefund any amount collected by means\nof administrative wage garnishment.(2) Unless required by Federal law or\n\ncontract, refunds under this section\nshall not bear interest. (o) Right of action.The agency may\nsue any employer for any amount that\nthe employer fails to withhold from\nwages owed and payable to an employee\nin accordance with paragraphs (g) and\n(i) of this section.However, a suit may\nnot be filed before the termination of the\ncollection action involving a particular\ndebtor, unless earlier filing is necessary\nto avoid expiration of any applicable\nstatute of limitations period.For\npurposes of this section, ‘‘termination of\nthe collection action’’ occurs when the\nagency has terminated collection action\nin accordance with the FCCS or other\napplicable standards.In any event,\ntermination of the collection action will\nhave been deemed to occur if the agency\nhas not received any payments to satisfy\nthe debt from the particular debtor\nwhose wages were subject to\ngarnishment, in whole or in part, for a\nperiod of one (1) year.Dated: April 30, 1998.

SUMMARY: This final rule implements\nthe administrative wage garnishment\nprovisions contained in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996\n(DCIA).Wage garnishment is a process\nwhereby an employer withholds\namounts from an employee’s wages and\npays those amounts to the employee’s\ncreditor in satisfaction of a withholding\norder.The DCIA authorizes Federal\nagencies administratively to garnish the\ndisposable pay of an individual to\ncollect delinquent nontax debts owed to\nthe United States in accordance with\nregulations issued by the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.DATES: This rule is effective June 5,\n1998.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nGerry Isenberg, Financial Program\nSpecialist, Debt Management Services,\nat (202) 874–6660 or James Regan,\nAttorney-Advisor, at (202) 874–6680,\nFinancial Management Service,\nDepartment of the Treasury, 401 14th\nStreet SW, Washington, DC 20227.This\ndocument is available for downloading\nfrom the Financial Management Service\nweb site at the following address: http:/\n/www.fms.treas.gov.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\nThis final rule implements the wage\n\ngarnishment provision in section\n31001(o) of the Debt Collection\nImprovement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Pub.L. 104–134, 110 Stat. 1321–358 (Apr.26,\n1996), codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D.Wage garnishment is a process whereby\nan employer withholds amounts from\nan employee’s wages and pays those\namounts to the employee’s creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.The\nDCIA authorizes Federal agencies\nadministratively to garnish up to 15% of\nthe disposable pay of a debtor to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.Prior to the enactment of\nthe DCIA, agencies were required to\nobtain a court judgment before\ngarnishing the wages of non-Federal\nemployees.Section 31001(o) of the\nDCIA preempts State laws that prohibit\nwage garnishment or otherwise govern\nwage garnishment procedures.As authorized by the DCIA, a Federal\n\nagency collecting delinquent nontax\ndebt may garnish administratively a\ndelinquent debtor’s wages in accordance\nwith regulations promulgated by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The Financial\nManagement Service (FMS), a bureau of\nthe Department of the Treasury, is\nresponsible for promulgating the\nregulations implementing this and other\ndebt collection tools established by the\nDCIA.In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.2. Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.For hearing requests\nthat are not received in the specified\ntime frame, an agency need not delay\nissuance of the withholding order prior\nto conducting a hearing.An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.The debtor bears the\nburden of informing the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. 3.Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.The DCIA prohibits employers from\ntaking disciplinary actions against the\ndebtor based on the fact that the debtor’s\nwages are subject to administrative\ngarnishment.In addition, the DCIA\n\nauthorizes an agency to sue an employer\nfor amounts not properly withheld from\nthe wages payable to the debtor.Discussion of Comments\n\nGeneral\n\nIn response to its Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking (NPRM) concerning\nAdministrative Wage Garnishment (62\nFR 62458, Nov. 21, 1997), FMS received\ncomments from Federal agencies,\nprivate collection agencies, an umbrella\norganization for organizations that\nsupport the activities of the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Programs, and a\nprivate citizen.Many of the commenters\nhave been involved in implementing a\nsimilar administrative wage\ngarnishment provision that authorizes\nthe U.S. Department of Education\n(Education) to garnish 10% of the\ndisposable pay of employed individuals\nwho have defaulted on their student\nloan obligations.See 20 U.S.C. 1095a;\n34 CFR 682.410.FMS drafted the NPRM\nafter consultation with the Departments\nof Education and Justice about their\nexperience implementing wage\ngarnishment to collect student loans.The comments received in response to\nthe NPRM based on the commenters’\nexperience with Education’s program\nhave been helpful in drafting the final\nrule.It is important to note that\nEducation’s wage garnishment program\nis applicable to the collection of one\ntype of debt subject to a single statutory\nscheme.The DCIA wage garnishment\nprovision and this rule, on the other\nhand, are applicable to all Federal\nagencies collecting all types of debt, the\ncollection of which is subject to a\nvariety of statutory provisions.Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(b) Scope\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\nincorrectly interpreted the DCIA in the\nNPRM by not limiting the applicability\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25137\n\nof administrative wage garnishment to\nthe collection of only those debts\nevidenced by written agreements.The\ncommenter believes that the language\ncontained in 31 U.S.C.3720D(a)\nauthorizing wage garnishment ‘‘if the\nindividual is not currently making\nrequired repayment in accordance with\nany agreement between the agency head\nand the individual’’ so limits the use of\nwage garnishment.FMS disagrees with\nthe commenter.There is nothing in the\nplain language of the statute to indicate\nthat the referenced phrase limits the\napplicability of wage garnishment to\ndebts evidenced by a written agreement.The term ‘‘debt,’’ as defined in 31 U.S.C.3701(b)(1), as amended by the DCIA, is\nnot limited to debts evidenced by a\nwritten agreement between the debtor\nand the Government.One commenter suggested that the\nrule establish a minimum threshold\namount for garnishment based on a cost\nestimate of the garnishment procedure.This is unnecessary since the use of the\nadministrative wage garnishment tool\nby agencies is voluntary and should be\nused by agencies in appropriate\nsituations.Agencies may set their own\npolicies regarding minimum thresholds.NPRM § 285.11(c) Definitions\n\nOne commenter suggested that the\n\ndefinition of agency under NPRM\n§ 285.11(c) be expanded to authorize\nagents or vendors of Federal agencies to\ngarnish debtors’ wages in accordance\nwith this rule.Whether or not an agent\nor vendor can perform a particular\nfunction on behalf of a Federal agency\nis beyond the scope of this rule.While\nthe use of contractors for the collection\nof debt generally is authorized by law,\nagencies may not contract out\n‘‘inherently governmental functions.’’\nSee Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) Circular A–76.This is not to say\nthat contractors cannot assist agencies\nin conducting administrative wage\ngarnishment.For example, contractors\ncould be hired to mail notices and\ngarnishment orders authorized by the\nagency, receive documents from the\ndebtor and the employer, and document\nagency-approved repayment agreements\nwith the debtor.NPRM § 285.11(d) General Rule\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\n\nclarify a statement in the NPRM\npreamble concerning NPRM § 285.11(d)\ninvolving the use of wage garnishment\nby Treasury-designated debt collection\ncenters.In addition to agencies that\nadminister the program that gives rise to\nthe debt, agencies that pursue the\nrecovery of the debt for those agencies,\nsuch as the Department of the Treasury,\n\nTreasury-designated debt collection\ncenters, and the Department of Justice,\nare authorized to conduct\nadministrative wage garnishment.See,\ne.g., the definition of ‘‘agency’’ in NPRM\n§ 285.11(c), unchanged in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(e) Notice\nRequirements\n\nThe suggestion by one commenter\nthat the rule specifically prohibit the\ncombination of an agency’s notice of\nintention to garnish a debtor’s wages\nwith other notices to the debtor has not\nbeen incorporated into this rule.The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.In\nmany circumstances, the debtor can be\ninformed clearly in a single\ncommunication of all debt collection\nremedies available to the Federal agency\nand the opportunities available to the\ndebtor to be heard concerning the\nexistence or amount of the debt.One commenter’s suggestion that FMS\ndevelop a standard administrative wage\ngarnishment notice for government-\nwide use has not been incorporated in\nthe final rule.Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.1692 et seq.,\nprovided that such entities comply with\nthe terms of this rule and use notices\nand forms developed by Treasury or\nother agencies.The extent to which the\nFDCPA may apply to any entity,\nparticularly private collection agencies,\nis outside the scope of this rule.Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.Other commenters\nsuggested that a certificate of service is\nunnecessary.The final rule retains the\nrequirement that an agency keep a\ncertificate of service as evidence of\nmailing.However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.Another\ncommenter questioned how an agency’s\n\nexisting hearing procedures for debt\ndetermination relate to the wage\ngarnishment requirements contained in\nthe DCIA and NPRM.The phrase\n‘‘consistent with this section’’ was\nadded to NPRM § 285.11(f)(1) in this\nfinal rule to clarify that agency\nregulations must follow the minimum\nrequirements for wage garnishment\nhearings as set forth in this rule.Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.Those agencies with hearings\nprocedures which meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand agency-specific statutory and other\nrequirements need not develop new\nhearing procedures.Agencies should\nseek legal advice from their agency\ncounsel to determine whether existing\nagency procedures meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand whether the agency is required to\npublish new or amended regulations.Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.One commenter recommended\namending NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) by\nestablishing that a debtor has 15\n‘‘calendar’’ days, rather than 15\n‘‘business’’ days, to request a hearing.FMS was concerned that 15 calendar\ndays would not allow sufficient time for\na debtor to request a hearing prior to the\nissuance of a garnishment order given\nthat 15 calendar days could include four\nto seven weekend days or holidays.For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.Several comments addressed the\nhearing procedures proposed in the\nNPRM.The final rule incorporates the\ncomment from two commenters\n\n\f25138\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nsuggesting that the requirement in\nNPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) that a debtor\nprove by ‘‘clear and convincing\nevidence’’ that no debt exists or that the\namount of the debt is incorrect is too\nburdensome.In the final rule at\n§ 285.11(f)(8)(ii), FMS replaced the\n‘‘clear and convincing’’ standard with\nthe less burdensome ‘‘preponderance of\nthe evidence’’ standard.One commenter suggested that\nproving the terms of the repayment\nschedule are ‘‘unreasonable,’’ as\nrequired at NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii), is\ntoo vague and that the debtor should be\nrequired to show that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule would cause a\n‘‘financial hardship’’ to the debtor.The\nfinal rule incorporates this suggestion.In response to a commenter’s\n\nsuggestion, NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the debtor\nmay present evidence that collection of\nthe debt may not be pursued due to\noperation of law, e.g., enforcement of\nthe order is subject to the automatic stay\nimposed at the time of a bankruptcy\nfiling pursuant to 11 U.S.C.362. Two commenters suggested that this\n\nrule restrict hearing officials to those\nindividuals not under the supervision or\ncontrol of the head of the agency.The\ncommenters suggested that the rule,\nwithout such a change, could result in\ninequitable wage garnishment hearing\ndecisions since an agency, and its\nqualified hearing officer, have a vested\ninterest in the outcome.FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.Unlike other statutes,\nsee, e.g., 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.Second, the rule explicitly sets forth\nminimum hearing procedures that\nensure the debtor has a meaningful\nopportunity to be heard and minimize\nthe risk of erroneous deprivation of the\ndebtor’s property interest in his or her\nwages.Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 706 (concerning\njudicial review of an agency’s actions).NPRM § 285.11(g) Wage Garnishment\nOrder\n\nOne commenter noted that the\nprovision under NPRM § 285.11(g)\nrequiring agencies to submit a wage\ngarnishment order to a debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days of a hearing\ndecision (or within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing) should be reconciled with the\n20 day period provided under\nEducation’s wage garnishment\n\nregulation at 34 CFR 682.410(b)(10)(H).Such a reconciliation with Education’s\nrule is not warranted or necessary.The\ntime period in this rule accommodates\na broad range of agencies’ requirements\nand is consistent with the goal of\nissuing a wage garnishment order\npromptly after notice and an\nopportunity to be heard have been\nprovided to the debtor.The final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(g)(2) be amended to delete the\nrequirement that the wage garnishment\norder be signed by the head of the\nagency or his/her designee.The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.Failure to include a signature on\na wage withholding order could result\nin employer uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the order and could result in\ndelay, and possible loss, of garnishment\npayments to which the Government is\nentitled.As noted in the NPRM and as\nsuggested by a commenter, FMS is\ndeveloping a wage garnishment order\nform.It is anticipated that the use of a\nstandard wage garnishment order form\nby agencies will make it easier for\nprivate sector employers to recognize\nand comply with agency wage\ngarnishment order requirements.This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.Nelson\nv. Diversified Collection Services, 961\nF.Supp. 863, 868–69 (D. Md. 1997).By\nrequiring an agency to retain a copy of\nthe certificate of service, the agency can\nproduce evidence that the order was\nmailed without having to place an\nadditional burden on the employer.One commenter suggested that the\nrequirement to comply with the wage\ngarnishment order should be waived\nunder circumstances when a small\n\nemployer (with less than five\nemployees) would be subject to a major\nhardship (financial or otherwise) as a\nresult of complying with the order.Such\na change to the rule is unnecessary since\nthe use of the wage garnishment\ncollection tool by agencies is not\nmandated under the DCIA.Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.NPRM § 285.11(h) Certification by\nEmployer\n\nThe final rule did not incorporate the\nrecommendation of two commenters to\ndelete the requirement under NPRM\n§ 285.11(h) requiring the debtor’s\nemployer to complete and return a\ncertification form to the agency.The\ncommenters suggested this provision is\nunduly burdensome and that an\nemployer’s failure to complete and\nreturn the form could unnecessarily\ndelay the garnishment process.The\ncertification form serves multiple\npurposes.One, the form provides the\nagency with information necessary to\nmonitor the employer’s compliance\nwith the wage garnishment order in\naccordance with the requirements of the\nDCIA and applicable laws.The form\nalso will provide information so the\nagency can calculate anticipated\ncollection amounts to determine\nwhether to pursue other collection tools.Finally, the form will assist the\nemployer in calculating the amount to\nbe garnished from the debtor’s\ndisposable pay.It is noted that the\nemployer’s failure to complete the\ncertification form as required does not\naffect the employer’s responsibility to\nwithhold the appropriate garnishment\namount within a ‘‘reasonable time’’ in\naccordance with this rule.See NPRM\n§ 285.11(i)(7), renumbered as\n§ 285.11(i)(8) in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(i) Amounts Withheld\nTwo commenters recommended\nclarifying the impact of the Consumer\nCredit Protection Act’s (CCPA)\nminimum disposable pay requirement\non the wage garnishment provisions of\nthe DCIA and this rule.See CCPA,\n§ 303(a)(2), codified at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (maximum allowable\ngarnishment).NPRM § 285.11(i) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the amount\nof garnishment is limited by the CCPA.Under section 285.11(i) of the final rule,\nthe amount of garnishment is the lesser\nof the amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay or the amount\nset forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2). The\namount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2)\nis the amount by which a debtor’s\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25139\n\ndisposable pay exceeds an amount\nequivalent to thirty times the minimum\nwage.For example, if a debtor receives\ndisposable pay of $160.00 per week and\nthirty times the minimum wage is\n$154.50, the amount that may be\ngarnished weekly is the lesser of $24.00\n(15% of $160) or $5.50 ($160.00–\n$154.40 = $5.50).See 29 CFR\n870.10(b)(1) for information on\ncalculating an amount equivalent to\nthirty times the minimum wage.Section 285.11(i)(3) of the final rule is\nthe same as NPRM § 285.11(i)(2) except\nthat § 285.11(i)(3)(iii) has been added to\nclarify the amount of garnishment for a\ndebtor who owes multiple debts to a\nsingle creditor agency.Under section\n285(i)(3)(iii) of the final rule, an agency\nmay issue multiple withholding orders\nso long as the total amount garnished\nfrom the debtor’s pay for such orders\ndoes not exceed the garnishment\namount permitted under § 285.11(i)(2).For purposes of § 285.11(i)(3)(iii), the\nterm ‘‘agency’’ refers to the agency that\nis owed the debt.One commenter suggested deleting\n\nthe language in NPRM § 285.11(i)(7)\n(renumbered as § 285.11(i)(8) in the\nfinal rule) requiring that the wage\ngarnishment order ‘‘indicate a\nreasonable period of time within which\nthe employer is required to commence\nwage withholding’’ because\ngarnishment orders in all other contexts\ntypically require immediate compliance.This suggestion was not incorporated\ninto the final rule.The ‘‘reasonable\nperiod of time’’ given to employers\nallows employers adequate time to\ncalculate garnishment withholding\npayroll data involving a debtor\nemployee without disrupting the normal\npayroll cycle.It is anticipated that a\n‘‘reasonable period of time’’ generally\nwill mean that the employer will\ncommence withholdings within two pay\ncycles following receipt of the\ngarnishment order.This may vary given\nan employer’s circumstances.NPRM § 285.11(j) Exclusions From\nGarnishment.No changes were made to the NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(k) Financial Hardship\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(k) be amended further to define\nthe standards for agency review of a\ndebtor’s request for an adjustment in the\namount withheld under a wage\ngarnishment order due to ‘‘financial\nhardship’’ based on ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances.’’ NPRM § 285.11(k),\nunchanged in the final rule, provides\n\nillustrative examples of the type of\nevents which may give rise to financial\nhardship due to ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances,’’ such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness.However, whether financial hardship\nexists must be determined by an\nagency’s review of the particular facts\nand circumstances of a given case.NPRM § 285.11(l) Ending Garnishment\nThe final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that the rule\nclarify whether collection costs need to\nbe collected before terminating the\ngarnishment action.NPRM § 285.11(l),\nunchanged in the final rule, clearly\nrequires termination of garnishment\nonly after the agency ‘‘has fully\nrecovered the amounts owed by the\ndebtor, including interest, penalties and\nadministrative costs consistent with the\nFCCS (Federal Claims Collection\nStandards).’’ See 31 U.S.C.3717(e) and\n4 CFR 102.13 regarding the collection of\nadministrative costs associated with a\ndebt.NPRM § 285.11(m) Actions Prohibited\nby the Employer\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(m).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(n) Refunds\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(o) Right of Action.The final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) be amended to remove the\nrequirement that a Federal agency must\n‘‘terminate collection action’’ as a\nprerequisite to commencing suit against\na debtor’s employer for failure to\nwithhold amounts from wages pursuant\nto a wage garnishment order.The DCIA\nspecifically provides that ‘‘suit (against\nan employer) may not be filed before the\ntermination of the collection action,\nunless earlier filing is necessary to avoid\nexpiration of any applicable statute of\nlimitations period.’’ 31 U.S.C. 3720D(f)(2)(B).However, FMS has amended NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(o) in the final rule to\nincorporate a suggestion by another\ncommenter that the rule be changed to\nclarify that ‘‘termination of the\ncollection action’’ merely refers to the\nparticular debtor/employee, rather than\nthe debt.This change gives agencies\nflexibility to terminate collection action\nagainst one of the debtors and file suit\nagainst that debtor’s employer for failing\nto withhold that debtor’s wages\npursuant to a wage garnishment order.At the same time, the agency could\ncontinue collection efforts involving the\nother debtors who are jointly and\nseverally liable to the agency on the\ndebt.Regulatory Analysis\n\nThis rule is not a significant\nregulatory action as defined in\nExecutive Order 12866.It is hereby\ncertified that this regulation, including\nthe certification referenced in this final\nrule (see paragraph (h) of this section),\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities.Although a substantial number\nof small entities will be subject to this\nregulation and to the certification\nrequirement in this rule, the\nrequirements will not have a significant\neconomic impact on these entities.Employers of delinquent debtors must\ncertify certain information about the\ndebtor such as the debtor’s employment\nstatus and earnings.This information is\ncontained in the employer’s payroll\nrecords.Therefore, it will not take a\nsignificant amount of time or result in\na significant cost for an employer to\ncomplete the certification form.Even if\nan employer is served withholding\norders on several employees over the\ncourse of a year, the cost imposed on the\nemployer to complete the certifications\nwould not have a significant economic\nimpact on that entity.Employers are not\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with a withholding\norder issued pursuant to this rule.List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 285\n\nAdministrative practice and\n\nprocedure, Claims, Debts, Garnishment\nof wages, Hearing and appeal\nprocedures, Salaries, Wages.Authority and Issuance\n\nFor the reasons set forth in

revised to read as follows:\n\nAuthority: 26 U.S.C.6402; 31 U.S.C. 321,\n3701, 3711, 3716, 3720A, 3720D; E.O.13019;\n3 CFR, 1996 Comp., p. 216. 2.Section 285.11 is added to Subpart\n\nB to read as follows:\n\n§ 285.11 Administrative wage\ngarnishment. (a) Purpose.This section provides\n\nprocedures for Federal agencies to\ncollect money from a debtor’s\n\n\f25140\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\ndisposable pay by means of\nadministrative wage garnishment to\nsatisfy delinquent nontax debt owed to\nthe United States. (b) Scope.(1) This section applies to\nany Federal agency that administers a\nprogram that gives rise to a delinquent\nnontax debt owed to the United States\nand to any agency that pursues recovery\nof such debt.(2) This section shall apply\n\nnotwithstanding any provision of State\nlaw.(3) Nothing in this section precludes\n\nthe compromise of a debt or the\nsuspension or termination of collection\naction in accordance with applicable\nlaw.See, for example, the Federal\nClaims Collection Standards (FCCS), 4\nCFR parts 101–105.(4) The receipt of payments pursuant\n\nto this section does not preclude a\nFederal agency from pursuing other debt\ncollection remedies, including the offset\nof Federal payments to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.A Federal agency may\npursue such debt collection remedies\nseparately or in conjunction with\nadministrative wage garnishment.(5) This section does not apply to the\n\ncollection of delinquent nontax debt\nowed to the United States from the\nwages of Federal employees from their\nFederal employment.Federal pay is\nsubject to the Federal salary offset\nprocedures set forth in 5 U.S.C.5514\nand other applicable laws.(6) Nothing in this section requires\n\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.the following definitions shall apply:\n\nAgency means a department, agency,\n\ncourt, court administrative office, or\ninstrumentality in the executive,\njudicial, or legislative branch of the\nFederal Government, including\ngovernment corporations.For purposes\nof this section, agency means either the\nagency that administers the program\nthat gave rise to the debt or the agency\nthat pursues recovery of the debt.Business day means Monday through\n\nFriday.For purposes of computation,\nthe last day of the period will be\nincluded unless it is a Federal legal\nholiday.Certificate of service means a\n\ncertificate signed by an agency official\nindicating the nature of the document to\nwhich it pertains, the date of mailing of\nthe document, and to whom the\ndocument is being sent.Day means calendar day. For\n\npurposes of computation, the last day of\nthe period will be included unless it is\n\na Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal legal\nholiday.Debt or claim means any amount of\nmoney, funds or property that has been\ndetermined by an appropriate official of\nthe Federal Government to be owed to\nthe United States by an individual,\nincluding debt administered by a third\nparty as an agent for the Federal\nGovernment.Delinquent nontax debt\nmeans any nontax debt that has not\nbeen paid by the date specified in the\nagency’s initial written demand for\npayment, or applicable agreement,\nunless other satisfactory payment\narrangements have been made.For\npurposes of this section, the terms\n‘‘debt’’ and ‘‘claim’’ are synonymous\nand refer to delinquent nontax debt.Debtor means an individual who owes\n\na delinquent nontax debt to the United\nStates.Disposable pay means that part of the\n\ndebtor’s compensation (including, but\nnot limited to, salary, bonuses,\ncommissions, and vacation pay) from an\nemployer remaining after the deduction\nof health insurance premiums and any\namounts required by law to be withheld.For purposes of this section, ‘‘amounts\nrequired by law to be withheld’’ include\namounts for deductions such as social\nsecurity taxes and withholding taxes,\nbut do not include any amount withheld\npursuant to a court order.Employer means a person or entity\nthat employs the services of others and\nthat pays their wages or salaries.The\nterm employer includes, but is not\nlimited to, State and local Governments,\nbut does not include an agency of the\nFederal Government.withholding amounts from an\nemployee’s disposable pay and the\npaying of those amounts to a creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.Withholding order means any order\nfor withholding or garnishment of pay\nissued by an agency, or judicial or\nadministrative body.For purposes of\nthis section, the terms ‘‘wage\ngarnishment order’’ and ‘‘garnishment\norder’’ have the same meaning as\n‘‘withholding order.’’\n\n(d) General rule.Whenever an agency\n\ndetermines that a delinquent debt is\nowed by an individual, the agency may\ninitiate proceedings administratively to\ngarnish the wages of the delinquent\ndebtor. (e) Notice requirements.(1) At least 30\ndays before the initiation of garnishment\nproceedings, the agency shall mail, by\nfirst class mail, to the debtor’s last\nknown address a written notice\ninforming the debtor of:\n\n(i) The nature and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The intention of the agency to\ninitiate proceedings to collect the debt\nthrough deductions from pay until the\ndebt and all accumulated interest,\npenalties and administrative costs are\npaid in full; and\n\n(iii) An explanation of the debtor’s\n\nrights, including those set forth in\nparagraph (e)(2) of this section, and the\ntime frame within which the debtor may\nexercise his or her rights.(2) The debtor shall be afforded the\n\nopportunity:\n\n(i) To inspect and copy agency\n\nrecords related to the debt;\n\n(ii) To enter into a written repayment\nagreement with the agency under terms\nagreeable to the agency; and\n\n(iii) For a hearing in accordance with\nparagraph (f) of this section concerning\nthe existence or the amount of the debt\nor the terms of the proposed repayment\nschedule under the garnishment order.However, the debtor is not entitled to a\nhearing concerning the terms of the\nproposed repayment schedule if these\nterms have been established by written\nagreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of\nthis section.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the notice.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes. (f) Hearing—(1) In general.Agencies\n\nshall prescribe regulations for the\nconduct of administrative wage\ngarnishment hearings consistent with\nthis section or shall adopt this section\nwithout change by reference. (2) Request for hearing.The agency\nshall provide a hearing, which at the\nagency’s option may be oral or written,\nif the debtor submits a written request\nfor a hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt or the terms of the\nrepayment schedule (for repayment\nschedules established other than by\nwritten agreement under paragraph\n(e)(2)(ii)) of this section.(3) Type of hearing or review.(i) For\npurposes of this section, whenever an\nagency is required to afford a debtor a\nhearing, the agency shall provide the\ndebtor with a reasonable opportunity for\nan oral hearing when the agency\ndetermines that the issues in dispute\ncannot be resolved by review of the\ndocumentary evidence, for example,\nwhen the validity of the claim turns on\nthe issue of credibility or veracity.(ii) If the agency determines that an\noral hearing is appropriate, the time and\nlocation of the hearing shall be\nestablished by the agency.An oral\nhearing may, at the debtor’s option, be\nconducted either in-person or by\ntelephone conference.All travel\n\n(c) Definitions. As used in this section\n\nGarnishment means the process of\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25141\n\nexpenses incurred by the debtor in\nconnection with an in-person hearing\nwill be borne by the debtor.All\ntelephonic charges incurred during the\nhearing will be the responsibility of the\nagency.(iii) In those cases when an oral\n\nhearing is not required by this section,\nan agency shall nevertheless accord the\ndebtor a ‘‘paper hearing,’’ that is, an\nagency will decide the issues in dispute\nbased upon a review of the written\nrecord.The agency will establish a\nreasonable deadline for the submission\nof evidence. (4) Effect of timely request.Subject to\n\nparagraph (f)(13) of this section, if the\ndebtor’s written request is received by\nthe agency on or before the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall not\nissue a withholding order under\nparagraph (g) of this section until the\ndebtor has been provided the requested\nhearing and a decision in accordance\nwith paragraphs (f)(10) and (f)(11) of\nthis section has been rendered.(5) Failure to timely request a hearing.If the debtor’s written request is\nreceived by the agency after the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall provide\na hearing to the debtor.However, the\nagency will not delay issuance of a\nwithholding order unless the agency\ndetermines that the delay in filing the\nrequest was caused by factors over\nwhich the debtor had no control, or the\nagency receives information that the\nagency believes justifies a delay or\ncancellation of the withholding order.(6) Hearing official. A hearing official\n\nmay be any qualified individual, as\ndetermined by the head of the agency,\nincluding an administrative law judge. (7) Procedure.After the debtor\n\nrequests a hearing, the hearing official\nshall notify the debtor of:\n\n(i) The date and time of a telephonic\n\nhearing;\n\n(ii) The date, time, and location of an\n\nin-person oral hearing; or\n\n(iii) The deadline for the submission\n\nof evidence for a written hearing.(8) Burden of proof. (i) The agency\nwill have the burden of going forward\nto prove the existence or amount of the\ndebt.(ii) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes\nthe existence or amount of the debt, the\ndebtor must present by a preponderance\nof the evidence that no debt exists or\nthat the amount of the debt is incorrect.In addition, the debtor may present\nevidence that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule are unlawful,\nwould cause a financial hardship to the\n\ndebtor, or that collection of the debt\nmay not be pursued due to operation of\nlaw.(9) Record. The hearing official must\n\nmaintain a summary record of any\nhearing provided under this section.A\nhearing is not required to be a formal\nevidentiary-type hearing, however,\nwitnesses who testify in oral hearings\nwill do so under oath or affirmation. (10) Date of decision.The hearing\nofficial shall issue a written opinion\nstating his or her decision, as soon as\npracticable, but not later than sixty (60)\ndays after the date on which the request\nfor such hearing was received by the\nagency.If an agency is unable to provide\nthe debtor with a hearing and render a\ndecision within 60 days after the receipt\nof the request for such hearing:\n\n(i) The agency may not issue a\n\nwithholding order until the hearing is\nheld and a decision rendered; or\n\n(ii) If the agency had previously\nissued a withholding order to the\ndebtor’s employer, the agency must\nsuspend the withholding order\nbeginning on the 61st day after the\nreceipt of the hearing request and\ncontinuing until a hearing is held and\na decision is rendered.(11) Content of decision. The written\n\ndecision shall include:\n\n(i) A summary of the facts presented;\n(ii) The hearing official’s findings,\n\nanalysis and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment\n\nschedules, if applicable.(12) Final agency action. The hearing\n\nofficial’s decision will be the final\nagency action for the purposes of\njudicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.701 et seq.). (13) Failure to appear.In the absence\nof good cause shown, a debtor who fails\nto appear at a hearing scheduled\npursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this\nsection will be deemed as not having\ntimely filed a request for a hearing. (g) Wage garnishment order.(1)\n\nUnless the agency receives information\nthat the agency believes justifies a delay\nor cancellation of the withholding order,\nthe agency shall send, by first class\nmail, a withholding order to the debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing (i.e., within 15 business days\nafter the mailing of the notice described\nin paragraph (e)(1) of this section), or, if\na timely request for a hearing is made\nby the debtor, within 30 days after a\nfinal decision is made by the agency to\nproceed with garnishment.(2) The withholding order sent to the\nemployer under paragraph (g)(1) of this\nsection shall be in a form prescribed by\nthe Secretary of the Treasury on the\n\nagency’s letterhead and signed by the\nhead of the agency or his/her delegatee.The order shall contain only the\ninformation necessary for the employer\nto comply with the withholding order.Such information includes the debtor’s\nname, address, and social security\nnumber, as well as instructions for\nwithholding and information as to\nwhere payments should be sent.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the order.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes.(h) Certification by employer.Along\nwith the withholding order, the agency\nshall send to the employer a\ncertification in a form prescribed by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The employer\nshall complete and return the\ncertification to the agency within the\ntime frame prescribed in the\ninstructions to the form.The\ncertification will address matters such\nas information about the debtor’s\nemployment status and disposable pay\navailable for withholding. (i) Amounts withheld.(1) After receipt\n\nof the garnishment order issued under\nthis section, the employer shall deduct\nfrom all disposable pay paid to the\napplicable debtor during each pay\nperiod the amount of garnishment\ndescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this\nsection.(2)(i) Subject to the provisions of\n\nparagraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this\nsection, the amount of garnishment\nshall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay; or\n\n(B) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment).The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a\ndebtor’s disposable pay exceeds an\namount equivalent to thirty times the\nminimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.(3) When a debtor’s pay is subject to\n\nwithholding orders with priority the\nfollowing shall apply:\n\n(i) Unless otherwise provided by\nFederal law, withholding orders issued\nunder this section shall be paid in the\namounts set forth under paragraph (i)(2)\nof this section and shall have priority\nover other withholding orders which are\nserved later in time.Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, withholding orders for\nfamily support shall have priority over\nwithholding orders issued under this\nsection.(ii) If amounts are being withheld\n\nfrom a debtor’s pay pursuant to a\nwithholding order served on an\nemployer before a withholding order\n\n\f25142\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nissued pursuant to this section, or if a\nwithholding order for family support is\nserved on an employer at any time, the\namounts withheld pursuant to the\nwithholding order issued under this\nsection shall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under\n\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of the\n\ndebtor’s disposable pay less the\namount(s) withheld under the\nwithholding order(s) with priority.(iii) If a debtor owes more than one\ndebt to an agency, the agency may issue\nmultiple withholding orders provided\nthat the total amount garnished from the\ndebtor’s pay for such orders does not\nexceed the amount set forth in\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section.For\npurposes of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the\nterm agency refers to the agency that is\nowed the debt.(4) An amount greater than that set\nforth in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of\nthis section may be withheld upon the\nwritten consent of debtor.(5) The employer shall promptly pay\n\nto the agency all amounts withheld in\naccordance with the withholding order\nissued pursuant to this section.(6) An employer shall not be required\nto vary its normal pay and disbursement\ncycles in order to comply with the\nwithholding order.(7) Any assignment or allotment by an\n\nemployee of his earnings shall be void\nto the extent it interferes with or\nprohibits execution of the withholding\norder issued under this section, except\nfor any assignment or allotment made\npursuant to a family support judgment\nor order.(8) The employer shall withhold the\nappropriate amount from the debtor’s\nwages for each pay period until the\nemployer receives notification from the\nagency to discontinue wage\nwithholding.The garnishment order\nshall indicate a reasonable period of\n\ntime within which the employer is\nrequired to commence wage\nwithholding.(j) Exclusions from garnishment.The\nagency may not garnish the wages of a\ndebtor who it knows has been\ninvoluntarily separated from\nemployment until the debtor has been\nreemployed continuously for at least 12\nmonths.The debtor has the burden of\ninforming the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. (k) Financial hardship.(1) A debtor\n\nwhose wages are subject to a wage\nwithholding order under this section,\nmay, at any time, request a review by\nthe agency of the amount garnished,\nbased on materially changed\ncircumstances such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness which\nresult in financial hardship.(2) A debtor requesting a review\nunder paragraph (k)(1) of this section\nshall submit the basis for claiming that\nthe current amount of garnishment\nresults in a financial hardship to the\ndebtor, along with supporting\ndocumentation.Agencies shall consider\nany information submitted in\naccordance with procedures and\nstandards established by the agency.(3) If a financial hardship is found,\nthe agency shall downwardly adjust, by\nan amount and for a period of time\nagreeable to the agency, the amount\ngarnished to reflect the debtor’s\nfinancial condition.The agency will\nnotify the employer of any adjustments\nto the amounts to be withheld. (l) Ending garnishment.(1) Once the\nagency has fully recovered the amounts\nowed by the debtor, including interest,\npenalties, and administrative costs\nconsistent with the FCCS, the agency\nshall send the debtor’s employer\nnotification to discontinue wage\nwithholding.(2) At least annually, an agency shall\n\nreview its debtors’ accounts to ensure\nthat garnishment has been terminated\nfor accounts that have been paid in full.(m) Actions prohibited by the\nemployer.An employer may not\ndischarge, refuse to employ, or take\ndisciplinary action against the debtor\ndue to the issuance of a withholding\norder under this section. (n) Refunds.(1) If a hearing official, at\n\na hearing held pursuant to paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section, determines that a\ndebt is not legally due and owing to the\nUnited States, the agency shall promptly\nrefund any amount collected by means\nof administrative wage garnishment.(2) Unless required by Federal law or\n\ncontract, refunds under this section\nshall not bear interest. (o) Right of action.The agency may\nsue any employer for any amount that\nthe employer fails to withhold from\nwages owed and payable to an employee\nin accordance with paragraphs (g) and\n(i) of this section.However, a suit may\nnot be filed before the termination of the\ncollection action involving a particular\ndebtor, unless earlier filing is necessary\nto avoid expiration of any applicable\nstatute of limitations period.For\npurposes of this section, ‘‘termination of\nthe collection action’’ occurs when the\nagency has terminated collection action\nin accordance with the FCCS or other\napplicable standards.In any event,\ntermination of the collection action will\nhave been deemed to occur if the agency\nhas not received any payments to satisfy\nthe debt from the particular debtor\nwhose wages were subject to\ngarnishment, in whole or in part, for a\nperiod of one (1) year.Dated: April 30, 1998.

The agency must provide the debtor with an opportunity to inspect and copy records related to the debt, to establish a repayment agreement, and to receive a hearing concerning the existence or amount of the debt and the terms of a repayment schedule. \n\n3. A hearing must be held prior to the issuance of a withholding order if the debtor’s request is timely received. \n\n4. The agency may not garnish the wages of a debtor who has been involuntarily separated from employment until that individual has been reemployed continuously for at least 12 months. \n\n5. The debtor bears the burden of informing the agency of the circumstances surrounding an involuntary separation from employment.",

SUMMARY: This final rule implements\nthe administrative wage garnishment\nprovisions contained in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996\n(DCIA).Wage garnishment is a process\nwhereby an employer withholds\namounts from an employee’s wages and\npays those amounts to the employee’s\ncreditor in satisfaction of a withholding\norder.The DCIA authorizes Federal\nagencies administratively to garnish the\ndisposable pay of an individual to\ncollect delinquent nontax debts owed to\nthe United States in accordance with\nregulations issued by the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.DATES: This rule is effective June 5,\n1998.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nGerry Isenberg, Financial Program\nSpecialist, Debt Management Services,\nat (202) 874–6660 or James Regan,\nAttorney-Advisor, at (202) 874–6680,\nFinancial Management Service,\nDepartment of the Treasury, 401 14th\nStreet SW, Washington, DC 20227.This\ndocument is available for downloading\nfrom the Financial Management Service\nweb site at the following address: http:/\n/www.fms.treas.gov.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\nThis final rule implements the wage\n\ngarnishment provision in section\n31001(o) of the Debt Collection\nImprovement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Pub.L. 104–134, 110 Stat. 1321–358 (Apr.26,\n1996), codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D.Wage garnishment is a process whereby\nan employer withholds amounts from\nan employee’s wages and pays those\namounts to the employee’s creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.The\nDCIA authorizes Federal agencies\nadministratively to garnish up to 15% of\nthe disposable pay of a debtor to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.Prior to the enactment of\nthe DCIA, agencies were required to\nobtain a court judgment before\ngarnishing the wages of non-Federal\nemployees.Section 31001(o) of the\nDCIA preempts State laws that prohibit\nwage garnishment or otherwise govern\nwage garnishment procedures.As authorized by the DCIA, a Federal\n\nagency collecting delinquent nontax\ndebt may garnish administratively a\ndelinquent debtor’s wages in accordance\nwith regulations promulgated by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The Financial\nManagement Service (FMS), a bureau of\nthe Department of the Treasury, is\nresponsible for promulgating the\nregulations implementing this and other\ndebt collection tools established by the\nDCIA.In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.2. Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.For hearing requests\nthat are not received in the specified\ntime frame, an agency need not delay\nissuance of the withholding order prior\nto conducting a hearing.An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.The debtor bears the\nburden of informing the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. 3.Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.The DCIA prohibits employers from\ntaking disciplinary actions against the\ndebtor based on the fact that the debtor’s\nwages are subject to administrative\ngarnishment.In addition, the DCIA\n\nauthorizes an agency to sue an employer\nfor amounts not properly withheld from\nthe wages payable to the debtor.Discussion of Comments\n\nGeneral\n\nIn response to its Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking (NPRM) concerning\nAdministrative Wage Garnishment (62\nFR 62458, Nov. 21, 1997), FMS received\ncomments from Federal agencies,\nprivate collection agencies, an umbrella\norganization for organizations that\nsupport the activities of the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Programs, and a\nprivate citizen.Many of the commenters\nhave been involved in implementing a\nsimilar administrative wage\ngarnishment provision that authorizes\nthe U.S. Department of Education\n(Education) to garnish 10% of the\ndisposable pay of employed individuals\nwho have defaulted on their student\nloan obligations.See 20 U.S.C. 1095a;\n34 CFR 682.410.FMS drafted the NPRM\nafter consultation with the Departments\nof Education and Justice about their\nexperience implementing wage\ngarnishment to collect student loans.The comments received in response to\nthe NPRM based on the commenters’\nexperience with Education’s program\nhave been helpful in drafting the final\nrule.It is important to note that\nEducation’s wage garnishment program\nis applicable to the collection of one\ntype of debt subject to a single statutory\nscheme.The DCIA wage garnishment\nprovision and this rule, on the other\nhand, are applicable to all Federal\nagencies collecting all types of debt, the\ncollection of which is subject to a\nvariety of statutory provisions.Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(b) Scope\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\nincorrectly interpreted the DCIA in the\nNPRM by not limiting the applicability\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25137\n\nof administrative wage garnishment to\nthe collection of only those debts\nevidenced by written agreements.The\ncommenter believes that the language\ncontained in 31 U.S.C.3720D(a)\nauthorizing wage garnishment ‘‘if the\nindividual is not currently making\nrequired repayment in accordance with\nany agreement between the agency head\nand the individual’’ so limits the use of\nwage garnishment.FMS disagrees with\nthe commenter.There is nothing in the\nplain language of the statute to indicate\nthat the referenced phrase limits the\napplicability of wage garnishment to\ndebts evidenced by a written agreement.The term ‘‘debt,’’ as defined in 31 U.S.C.3701(b)(1), as amended by the DCIA, is\nnot limited to debts evidenced by a\nwritten agreement between the debtor\nand the Government.One commenter suggested that the\nrule establish a minimum threshold\namount for garnishment based on a cost\nestimate of the garnishment procedure.This is unnecessary since the use of the\nadministrative wage garnishment tool\nby agencies is voluntary and should be\nused by agencies in appropriate\nsituations.Agencies may set their own\npolicies regarding minimum thresholds.NPRM § 285.11(c) Definitions\n\nOne commenter suggested that the\n\ndefinition of agency under NPRM\n§ 285.11(c) be expanded to authorize\nagents or vendors of Federal agencies to\ngarnish debtors’ wages in accordance\nwith this rule.Whether or not an agent\nor vendor can perform a particular\nfunction on behalf of a Federal agency\nis beyond the scope of this rule.While\nthe use of contractors for the collection\nof debt generally is authorized by law,\nagencies may not contract out\n‘‘inherently governmental functions.’’\nSee Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) Circular A–76.This is not to say\nthat contractors cannot assist agencies\nin conducting administrative wage\ngarnishment.For example, contractors\ncould be hired to mail notices and\ngarnishment orders authorized by the\nagency, receive documents from the\ndebtor and the employer, and document\nagency-approved repayment agreements\nwith the debtor.NPRM § 285.11(d) General Rule\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\n\nclarify a statement in the NPRM\npreamble concerning NPRM § 285.11(d)\ninvolving the use of wage garnishment\nby Treasury-designated debt collection\ncenters.In addition to agencies that\nadminister the program that gives rise to\nthe debt, agencies that pursue the\nrecovery of the debt for those agencies,\nsuch as the Department of the Treasury,\n\nTreasury-designated debt collection\ncenters, and the Department of Justice,\nare authorized to conduct\nadministrative wage garnishment.See,\ne.g., the definition of ‘‘agency’’ in NPRM\n§ 285.11(c), unchanged in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(e) Notice\nRequirements\n\nThe suggestion by one commenter\nthat the rule specifically prohibit the\ncombination of an agency’s notice of\nintention to garnish a debtor’s wages\nwith other notices to the debtor has not\nbeen incorporated into this rule.The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.In\nmany circumstances, the debtor can be\ninformed clearly in a single\ncommunication of all debt collection\nremedies available to the Federal agency\nand the opportunities available to the\ndebtor to be heard concerning the\nexistence or amount of the debt.One commenter’s suggestion that FMS\ndevelop a standard administrative wage\ngarnishment notice for government-\nwide use has not been incorporated in\nthe final rule.Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.1692 et seq.,\nprovided that such entities comply with\nthe terms of this rule and use notices\nand forms developed by Treasury or\nother agencies.The extent to which the\nFDCPA may apply to any entity,\nparticularly private collection agencies,\nis outside the scope of this rule.Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.Other commenters\nsuggested that a certificate of service is\nunnecessary.The final rule retains the\nrequirement that an agency keep a\ncertificate of service as evidence of\nmailing.However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.Another\ncommenter questioned how an agency’s\n\nexisting hearing procedures for debt\ndetermination relate to the wage\ngarnishment requirements contained in\nthe DCIA and NPRM.The phrase\n‘‘consistent with this section’’ was\nadded to NPRM § 285.11(f)(1) in this\nfinal rule to clarify that agency\nregulations must follow the minimum\nrequirements for wage garnishment\nhearings as set forth in this rule.Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.Those agencies with hearings\nprocedures which meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand agency-specific statutory and other\nrequirements need not develop new\nhearing procedures.Agencies should\nseek legal advice from their agency\ncounsel to determine whether existing\nagency procedures meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand whether the agency is required to\npublish new or amended regulations.Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.One commenter recommended\namending NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) by\nestablishing that a debtor has 15\n‘‘calendar’’ days, rather than 15\n‘‘business’’ days, to request a hearing.FMS was concerned that 15 calendar\ndays would not allow sufficient time for\na debtor to request a hearing prior to the\nissuance of a garnishment order given\nthat 15 calendar days could include four\nto seven weekend days or holidays.For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.Several comments addressed the\nhearing procedures proposed in the\nNPRM.The final rule incorporates the\ncomment from two commenters\n\n\f25138\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nsuggesting that the requirement in\nNPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) that a debtor\nprove by ‘‘clear and convincing\nevidence’’ that no debt exists or that the\namount of the debt is incorrect is too\nburdensome.In the final rule at\n§ 285.11(f)(8)(ii), FMS replaced the\n‘‘clear and convincing’’ standard with\nthe less burdensome ‘‘preponderance of\nthe evidence’’ standard.One commenter suggested that\nproving the terms of the repayment\nschedule are ‘‘unreasonable,’’ as\nrequired at NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii), is\ntoo vague and that the debtor should be\nrequired to show that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule would cause a\n‘‘financial hardship’’ to the debtor.The\nfinal rule incorporates this suggestion.In response to a commenter’s\n\nsuggestion, NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the debtor\nmay present evidence that collection of\nthe debt may not be pursued due to\noperation of law, e.g., enforcement of\nthe order is subject to the automatic stay\nimposed at the time of a bankruptcy\nfiling pursuant to 11 U.S.C.362. Two commenters suggested that this\n\nrule restrict hearing officials to those\nindividuals not under the supervision or\ncontrol of the head of the agency.The\ncommenters suggested that the rule,\nwithout such a change, could result in\ninequitable wage garnishment hearing\ndecisions since an agency, and its\nqualified hearing officer, have a vested\ninterest in the outcome.FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.Unlike other statutes,\nsee, e.g., 5 U.S.C.5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.Second, the rule explicitly sets forth\nminimum hearing procedures that\nensure the debtor has a meaningful\nopportunity to be heard and minimize\nthe risk of erroneous deprivation of the\ndebtor’s property interest in his or her\nwages.Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 706 (concerning\njudicial review of an agency’s actions).NPRM § 285.11(g) Wage Garnishment\nOrder\n\nOne commenter noted that the\nprovision under NPRM § 285.11(g)\nrequiring agencies to submit a wage\ngarnishment order to a debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days of a hearing\ndecision (or within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing) should be reconciled with the\n20 day period provided under\nEducation’s wage garnishment\n\nregulation at 34 CFR 682.410(b)(10)(H).Such a reconciliation with Education’s\nrule is not warranted or necessary.The\ntime period in this rule accommodates\na broad range of agencies’ requirements\nand is consistent with the goal of\nissuing a wage garnishment order\npromptly after notice and an\nopportunity to be heard have been\nprovided to the debtor.The final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(g)(2) be amended to delete the\nrequirement that the wage garnishment\norder be signed by the head of the\nagency or his/her designee.The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.Failure to include a signature on\na wage withholding order could result\nin employer uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the order and could result in\ndelay, and possible loss, of garnishment\npayments to which the Government is\nentitled.As noted in the NPRM and as\nsuggested by a commenter, FMS is\ndeveloping a wage garnishment order\nform.It is anticipated that the use of a\nstandard wage garnishment order form\nby agencies will make it easier for\nprivate sector employers to recognize\nand comply with agency wage\ngarnishment order requirements.This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.Nelson\nv. Diversified Collection Services, 961\nF.Supp. 863, 868–69 (D. Md. 1997).By\nrequiring an agency to retain a copy of\nthe certificate of service, the agency can\nproduce evidence that the order was\nmailed without having to place an\nadditional burden on the employer.One commenter suggested that the\nrequirement to comply with the wage\ngarnishment order should be waived\nunder circumstances when a small\n\nemployer (with less than five\nemployees) would be subject to a major\nhardship (financial or otherwise) as a\nresult of complying with the order.Such\na change to the rule is unnecessary since\nthe use of the wage garnishment\ncollection tool by agencies is not\nmandated under the DCIA.Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.NPRM § 285.11(h) Certification by\nEmployer\n\nThe final rule did not incorporate the\nrecommendation of two commenters to\ndelete the requirement under NPRM\n§ 285.11(h) requiring the debtor’s\nemployer to complete and return a\ncertification form to the agency.The\ncommenters suggested this provision is\nunduly burdensome and that an\nemployer’s failure to complete and\nreturn the form could unnecessarily\ndelay the garnishment process.The\ncertification form serves multiple\npurposes.One, the form provides the\nagency with information necessary to\nmonitor the employer’s compliance\nwith the wage garnishment order in\naccordance with the requirements of the\nDCIA and applicable laws.The form\nalso will provide information so the\nagency can calculate anticipated\ncollection amounts to determine\nwhether to pursue other collection tools.Finally, the form will assist the\nemployer in calculating the amount to\nbe garnished from the debtor’s\ndisposable pay.It is noted that the\nemployer’s failure to complete the\ncertification form as required does not\naffect the employer’s responsibility to\nwithhold the appropriate garnishment\namount within a ‘‘reasonable time’’ in\naccordance with this rule.See NPRM\n§ 285.11(i)(7), renumbered as\n§ 285.11(i)(8) in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(i) Amounts Withheld\nTwo commenters recommended\nclarifying the impact of the Consumer\nCredit Protection Act’s (CCPA)\nminimum disposable pay requirement\non the wage garnishment provisions of\nthe DCIA and this rule.See CCPA,\n§ 303(a)(2), codified at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (maximum allowable\ngarnishment).NPRM § 285.11(i) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the amount\nof garnishment is limited by the CCPA.Under section 285.11(i) of the final rule,\nthe amount of garnishment is the lesser\nof the amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay or the amount\nset forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2). The\namount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2)\nis the amount by which a debtor’s\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25139\n\ndisposable pay exceeds an amount\nequivalent to thirty times the minimum\nwage.For example, if a debtor receives\ndisposable pay of $160.00 per week and\nthirty times the minimum wage is\n$154.50, the amount that may be\ngarnished weekly is the lesser of $24.00\n(15% of $160) or $5.50 ($160.00–\n$154.40 = $5.50).See 29 CFR\n870.10(b)(1) for information on\ncalculating an amount equivalent to\nthirty times the minimum wage.Section 285.11(i)(3) of the final rule is\nthe same as NPRM § 285.11(i)(2) except\nthat § 285.11(i)(3)(iii) has been added to\nclarify the amount of garnishment for a\ndebtor who owes multiple debts to a\nsingle creditor agency.Under section\n285(i)(3)(iii) of the final rule, an agency\nmay issue multiple withholding orders\nso long as the total amount garnished\nfrom the debtor’s pay for such orders\ndoes not exceed the garnishment\namount permitted under § 285.11(i)(2).For purposes of § 285.11(i)(3)(iii), the\nterm ‘‘agency’’ refers to the agency that\nis owed the debt.One commenter suggested deleting\n\nthe language in NPRM § 285.11(i)(7)\n(renumbered as § 285.11(i)(8) in the\nfinal rule) requiring that the wage\ngarnishment order ‘‘indicate a\nreasonable period of time within which\nthe employer is required to commence\nwage withholding’’ because\ngarnishment orders in all other contexts\ntypically require immediate compliance.This suggestion was not incorporated\ninto the final rule.The ‘‘reasonable\nperiod of time’’ given to employers\nallows employers adequate time to\ncalculate garnishment withholding\npayroll data involving a debtor\nemployee without disrupting the normal\npayroll cycle.It is anticipated that a\n‘‘reasonable period of time’’ generally\nwill mean that the employer will\ncommence withholdings within two pay\ncycles following receipt of the\ngarnishment order.This may vary given\nan employer’s circumstances.NPRM § 285.11(j) Exclusions From\nGarnishment.No changes were made to the NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(k) Financial Hardship\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(k) be amended further to define\nthe standards for agency review of a\ndebtor’s request for an adjustment in the\namount withheld under a wage\ngarnishment order due to ‘‘financial\nhardship’’ based on ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances.’’ NPRM § 285.11(k),\nunchanged in the final rule, provides\n\nillustrative examples of the type of\nevents which may give rise to financial\nhardship due to ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances,’’ such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness.However, whether financial hardship\nexists must be determined by an\nagency’s review of the particular facts\nand circumstances of a given case.NPRM § 285.11(l) Ending Garnishment\nThe final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that the rule\nclarify whether collection costs need to\nbe collected before terminating the\ngarnishment action.NPRM § 285.11(l),\nunchanged in the final rule, clearly\nrequires termination of garnishment\nonly after the agency ‘‘has fully\nrecovered the amounts owed by the\ndebtor, including interest, penalties and\nadministrative costs consistent with the\nFCCS (Federal Claims Collection\nStandards).’’ See 31 U.S.C.3717(e) and\n4 CFR 102.13 regarding the collection of\nadministrative costs associated with a\ndebt.NPRM § 285.11(m) Actions Prohibited\nby the Employer\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(m).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(n) Refunds\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(n).FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.NPRM § 285.11(o) Right of Action.The final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) be amended to remove the\nrequirement that a Federal agency must\n‘‘terminate collection action’’ as a\nprerequisite to commencing suit against\na debtor’s employer for failure to\nwithhold amounts from wages pursuant\nto a wage garnishment order.The DCIA\nspecifically provides that ‘‘suit (against\nan employer) may not be filed before the\ntermination of the collection action,\nunless earlier filing is necessary to avoid\nexpiration of any applicable statute of\nlimitations period.’’ 31 U.S.C. 3720D(f)(2)(B).However, FMS has amended NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(o) in the final rule to\nincorporate a suggestion by another\ncommenter that the rule be changed to\nclarify that ‘‘termination of the\ncollection action’’ merely refers to the\nparticular debtor/employee, rather than\nthe debt.This change gives agencies\nflexibility to terminate collection action\nagainst one of the debtors and file suit\nagainst that debtor’s employer for failing\nto withhold that debtor’s wages\npursuant to a wage garnishment order.At the same time, the agency could\ncontinue collection efforts involving the\nother debtors who are jointly and\nseverally liable to the agency on the\ndebt.Regulatory Analysis\n\nThis rule is not a significant\nregulatory action as defined in\nExecutive Order 12866.It is hereby\ncertified that this regulation, including\nthe certification referenced in this final\nrule (see paragraph (h) of this section),\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities.Although a substantial number\nof small entities will be subject to this\nregulation and to the certification\nrequirement in this rule, the\nrequirements will not have a significant\neconomic impact on these entities.Employers of delinquent debtors must\ncertify certain information about the\ndebtor such as the debtor’s employment\nstatus and earnings.This information is\ncontained in the employer’s payroll\nrecords.Therefore, it will not take a\nsignificant amount of time or result in\na significant cost for an employer to\ncomplete the certification form.Even if\nan employer is served withholding\norders on several employees over the\ncourse of a year, the cost imposed on the\nemployer to complete the certifications\nwould not have a significant economic\nimpact on that entity.Employers are not\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with a withholding\norder issued pursuant to this rule.List of Subjects in 31 CFR Part 285\n\nAdministrative practice and\n\nprocedure, Claims, Debts, Garnishment\nof wages, Hearing and appeal\nprocedures, Salaries, Wages.Authority and Issuance\n\nFor the reasons set forth in the\n\npreamble, 31 CFR part 285 is amended\nas follows:\n\nPART 285—DEBT COLLECTION\nAUTHORITIES UNDER THE DEBT\nCOLLECTION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF\n1996\n\n1.The authority citation for part 285\n\nis

follows:\n\n§ 285.11 Administrative wage\ngarnishment. (a) Purpose.This section provides\n\nprocedures for Federal agencies to\ncollect money from a debtor’s\n\n\f25140\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\ndisposable pay by means of\nadministrative wage garnishment to\nsatisfy delinquent nontax debt owed to\nthe United States. (b) Scope.(1) This section applies to\nany Federal agency that administers a\nprogram that gives rise to a delinquent\nnontax debt owed to the United States\nand to any agency that pursues recovery\nof such debt.(2) This section shall apply\n\nnotwithstanding any provision of State\nlaw.(3) Nothing in this section precludes\n\nthe compromise of a debt or the\nsuspension or termination of collection\naction in accordance with applicable\nlaw.See, for example, the Federal\nClaims Collection Standards (FCCS), 4\nCFR parts 101–105.(4) The receipt of payments pursuant\n\nto this section does not preclude a\nFederal agency from pursuing other debt\ncollection remedies, including the offset\nof Federal payments to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.A Federal agency may\npursue such debt collection remedies\nseparately or in conjunction with\nadministrative wage garnishment.(5) This section does not apply to the\n\ncollection of delinquent nontax debt\nowed to the United States from the\nwages of Federal employees from their\nFederal employment.Federal pay is\nsubject to the Federal salary offset\nprocedures set forth in 5 U.S.C.5514\nand other applicable laws.(6) Nothing in this section requires\n\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.the following definitions shall apply:\n\nAgency means a department, agency,\n\ncourt, court administrative office, or\ninstrumentality in the executive,\njudicial, or legislative branch of the\nFederal Government, including\ngovernment corporations.For purposes\nof this section, agency means either the\nagency that administers the program\nthat gave rise to the debt or the agency\nthat pursues recovery of the debt.Business day means Monday through\n\nFriday.For purposes of computation,\nthe last day of the period will be\nincluded unless it is a Federal legal\nholiday.Certificate of service means a\n\ncertificate signed by an agency official\nindicating the nature of the document to\nwhich it pertains, the date of mailing of\nthe document, and to whom the\ndocument is being sent.Day means calendar day. For\n\npurposes of computation, the last day of\nthe period will be included unless it is\n\na Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal legal\nholiday.Debt or claim means any amount of\nmoney, funds or property that has been\ndetermined by an appropriate official of\nthe Federal Government to be owed to\nthe United States by an individual,\nincluding debt administered by a third\nparty as an agent for the Federal\nGovernment.Delinquent nontax debt\nmeans any nontax debt that has not\nbeen paid by the date specified in the\nagency’s initial written demand for\npayment, or applicable agreement,\nunless other satisfactory payment\narrangements have been made.For\npurposes of this section, the terms\n‘‘debt’’ and ‘‘claim’’ are synonymous\nand refer to delinquent nontax debt.Debtor means an individual who owes\n\na delinquent nontax debt to the United\nStates.Disposable pay means that part of the\n\ndebtor’s compensation (including, but\nnot limited to, salary, bonuses,\ncommissions, and vacation pay) from an\nemployer remaining after the deduction\nof health insurance premiums and any\namounts required by law to be withheld.For purposes of this section, ‘‘amounts\nrequired by law to be withheld’’ include\namounts for deductions such as social\nsecurity taxes and withholding taxes,\nbut do not include any amount withheld\npursuant to a court order.Employer means a person or entity\nthat employs the services of others and\nthat pays their wages or salaries.The\nterm employer includes, but is not\nlimited to, State and local Governments,\nbut does not include an agency of the\nFederal Government.withholding amounts from an\nemployee’s disposable pay and the\npaying of those amounts to a creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.Withholding order means any order\nfor withholding or garnishment of pay\nissued by an agency, or judicial or\nadministrative body.For purposes of\nthis section, the terms ‘‘wage\ngarnishment order’’ and ‘‘garnishment\norder’’ have the same meaning as\n‘‘withholding order.’’\n\n(d) General rule.Whenever an agency\n\ndetermines that a delinquent debt is\nowed by an individual, the agency may\ninitiate proceedings administratively to\ngarnish the wages of the delinquent\ndebtor. (e) Notice requirements.(1) At least 30\ndays before the initiation of garnishment\nproceedings, the agency shall mail, by\nfirst class mail, to the debtor’s last\nknown address a written notice\ninforming the debtor of:\n\n(i) The nature and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The intention of the agency to\ninitiate proceedings to collect the debt\nthrough deductions from pay until the\ndebt and all accumulated interest,\npenalties and administrative costs are\npaid in full; and\n\n(iii) An explanation of the debtor’s\n\nrights, including those set forth in\nparagraph (e)(2) of this section, and the\ntime frame within which the debtor may\nexercise his or her rights.(2) The debtor shall be afforded the\n\nopportunity:\n\n(i) To inspect and copy agency\n\nrecords related to the debt;\n\n(ii) To enter into a written repayment\nagreement with the agency under terms\nagreeable to the agency; and\n\n(iii) For a hearing in accordance with\nparagraph (f) of this section concerning\nthe existence or the amount of the debt\nor the terms of the proposed repayment\nschedule under the garnishment order.However, the debtor is not entitled to a\nhearing concerning the terms of the\nproposed repayment schedule if these\nterms have been established by written\nagreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of\nthis section.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the notice.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes. (f) Hearing—(1) In general.Agencies\n\nshall prescribe regulations for the\nconduct of administrative wage\ngarnishment hearings consistent with\nthis section or shall adopt this section\nwithout change by reference. (2) Request for hearing.The agency\nshall provide a hearing, which at the\nagency’s option may be oral or written,\nif the debtor submits a written request\nfor a hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt or the terms of the\nrepayment schedule (for repayment\nschedules established other than by\nwritten agreement under paragraph\n(e)(2)(ii)) of this section.(3) Type of hearing or review.(i) For\npurposes of this section, whenever an\nagency is required to afford a debtor a\nhearing, the agency shall provide the\ndebtor with a reasonable opportunity for\nan oral hearing when the agency\ndetermines that the issues in dispute\ncannot be resolved by review of the\ndocumentary evidence, for example,\nwhen the validity of the claim turns on\nthe issue of credibility or veracity.(ii) If the agency determines that an\noral hearing is appropriate, the time and\nlocation of the hearing shall be\nestablished by the agency.An oral\nhearing may, at the debtor’s option, be\nconducted either in-person or by\ntelephone conference.All travel\n\n(c) Definitions. As used in this section\n\nGarnishment means the process of\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25141\n\nexpenses incurred by the debtor in\nconnection with an in-person hearing\nwill be borne by the debtor.All\ntelephonic charges incurred during the\nhearing will be the responsibility of the\nagency.(iii) In those cases when an oral\n\nhearing is not required by this section,\nan agency shall nevertheless accord the\ndebtor a ‘‘paper hearing,’’ that is, an\nagency will decide the issues in dispute\nbased upon a review of the written\nrecord.The agency will establish a\nreasonable deadline for the submission\nof evidence. (4) Effect of timely request.Subject to\n\nparagraph (f)(13) of this section, if the\ndebtor’s written request is received by\nthe agency on or before the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall not\nissue a withholding order under\nparagraph (g) of this section until the\ndebtor has been provided the requested\nhearing and a decision in accordance\nwith paragraphs (f)(10) and (f)(11) of\nthis section has been rendered.(5) Failure to timely request a hearing.If the debtor’s written request is\nreceived by the agency after the 15th\nbusiness day following the mailing of\nthe notice described in paragraph (e)(1)\nof this section, the agency shall provide\na hearing to the debtor.However, the\nagency will not delay issuance of a\nwithholding order unless the agency\ndetermines that the delay in filing the\nrequest was caused by factors over\nwhich the debtor had no control, or the\nagency receives information that the\nagency believes justifies a delay or\ncancellation of the withholding order.(6) Hearing official. A hearing official\n\nmay be any qualified individual, as\ndetermined by the head of the agency,\nincluding an administrative law judge. (7) Procedure.After the debtor\n\nrequests a hearing, the hearing official\nshall notify the debtor of:\n\n(i) The date and time of a telephonic\n\nhearing;\n\n(ii) The date, time, and location of an\n\nin-person oral hearing; or\n\n(iii) The deadline for the submission\n\nof evidence for a written hearing.(8) Burden of proof. (i) The agency\nwill have the burden of going forward\nto prove the existence or amount of the\ndebt.(ii) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes\nthe existence or amount of the debt, the\ndebtor must present by a preponderance\nof the evidence that no debt exists or\nthat the amount of the debt is incorrect.In addition, the debtor may present\nevidence that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule are unlawful,\nwould cause a financial hardship to the\n\ndebtor, or that collection of the debt\nmay not be pursued due to operation of\nlaw.(9) Record. The hearing official must\n\nmaintain a summary record of any\nhearing provided under this section.A\nhearing is not required to be a formal\nevidentiary-type hearing, however,\nwitnesses who testify in oral hearings\nwill do so under oath or affirmation. (10) Date of decision.The hearing\nofficial shall issue a written opinion\nstating his or her decision, as soon as\npracticable, but not later than sixty (60)\ndays after the date on which the request\nfor such hearing was received by the\nagency.If an agency is unable to provide\nthe debtor with a hearing and render a\ndecision within 60 days after the receipt\nof the request for such hearing:\n\n(i) The agency may not issue a\n\nwithholding order until the hearing is\nheld and a decision rendered; or\n\n(ii) If the agency had previously\nissued a withholding order to the\ndebtor’s employer, the agency must\nsuspend the withholding order\nbeginning on the 61st day after the\nreceipt of the hearing request and\ncontinuing until a hearing is held and\na decision is rendered.(11) Content of decision. The written\n\ndecision shall include:\n\n(i) A summary of the facts presented;\n(ii) The hearing official’s findings,\n\nanalysis and conclusions; and\n\n(iii) The terms of any repayment\n\nschedules, if applicable.(12) Final agency action. The hearing\n\nofficial’s decision will be the final\nagency action for the purposes of\njudicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.701 et seq.). (13) Failure to appear.In the absence\nof good cause shown, a debtor who fails\nto appear at a hearing scheduled\npursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this\nsection will be deemed as not having\ntimely filed a request for a hearing. (g) Wage garnishment order.(1)\n\nUnless the agency receives information\nthat the agency believes justifies a delay\nor cancellation of the withholding order,\nthe agency shall send, by first class\nmail, a withholding order to the debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing (i.e., within 15 business days\nafter the mailing of the notice described\nin paragraph (e)(1) of this section), or, if\na timely request for a hearing is made\nby the debtor, within 30 days after a\nfinal decision is made by the agency to\nproceed with garnishment.(2) The withholding order sent to the\nemployer under paragraph (g)(1) of this\nsection shall be in a form prescribed by\nthe Secretary of the Treasury on the\n\nagency’s letterhead and signed by the\nhead of the agency or his/her delegatee.The order shall contain only the\ninformation necessary for the employer\nto comply with the withholding order.Such information includes the debtor’s\nname, address, and social security\nnumber, as well as instructions for\nwithholding and information as to\nwhere payments should be sent.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the order.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes.(h) Certification by employer.Along\nwith the withholding order, the agency\nshall send to the employer a\ncertification in a form prescribed by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The employer\nshall complete and return the\ncertification to the agency within the\ntime frame prescribed in the\ninstructions to the form.The\ncertification will address matters such\nas information about the debtor’s\nemployment status and disposable pay\navailable for withholding. (i) Amounts withheld.(1) After receipt\n\nof the garnishment order issued under\nthis section, the employer shall deduct\nfrom all disposable pay paid to the\napplicable debtor during each pay\nperiod the amount of garnishment\ndescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this\nsection.(2)(i) Subject to the provisions of\n\nparagraphs (i)(3) and (i)(4) of this\nsection, the amount of garnishment\nshall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay; or\n\n(B) The amount set forth in 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) (Restriction on Garnishment).The amount set forth at 15 U.S.C.1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a\ndebtor’s disposable pay exceeds an\namount equivalent to thirty times the\nminimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.(3) When a debtor’s pay is subject to\n\nwithholding orders with priority the\nfollowing shall apply:\n\n(i) Unless otherwise provided by\nFederal law, withholding orders issued\nunder this section shall be paid in the\namounts set forth under paragraph (i)(2)\nof this section and shall have priority\nover other withholding orders which are\nserved later in time.Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, withholding orders for\nfamily support shall have priority over\nwithholding orders issued under this\nsection.(ii) If amounts are being withheld\n\nfrom a debtor’s pay pursuant to a\nwithholding order served on an\nemployer before a withholding order\n\n\f25142\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nissued pursuant to this section, or if a\nwithholding order for family support is\nserved on an employer at any time, the\namounts withheld pursuant to the\nwithholding order issued under this\nsection shall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under\n\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of the\n\ndebtor’s disposable pay less the\namount(s) withheld under the\nwithholding order(s) with priority.(iii) If a debtor owes more than one\ndebt to an agency, the agency may issue\nmultiple withholding orders provided\nthat the total amount garnished from the\ndebtor’s pay for such orders does not\nexceed the amount set forth in\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section.For\npurposes of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the\nterm agency refers to the agency that is\nowed the debt.(4) An amount greater than that set\nforth in paragraphs (i)(2) and (i)(3) of\nthis section may be withheld upon the\nwritten consent of debtor.(5) The employer shall promptly pay\n\nto the agency all amounts withheld in\naccordance with the withholding order\nissued pursuant to this section.(6) An employer shall not be required\nto vary its normal pay and disbursement\ncycles in order to comply with the\nwithholding order.(7) Any assignment or allotment by an\n\nemployee of his earnings shall be void\nto the extent it interferes with or\nprohibits execution of the withholding\norder issued under this section, except\nfor any assignment or allotment made\npursuant to a family support judgment\nor order.(8) The employer shall withhold the\nappropriate amount from the debtor’s\nwages for each pay period until the\nemployer receives notification from the\nagency to discontinue wage\nwithholding.The garnishment order\nshall indicate a reasonable period of\n\ntime within which the employer is\nrequired to commence wage\nwithholding.(j) Exclusions from garnishment.The\nagency may not garnish the wages of a\ndebtor who it knows has been\ninvoluntarily separated from\nemployment until the debtor has been\nreemployed continuously for at least 12\nmonths.The debtor has the burden of\ninforming the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. (k) Financial hardship.(1) A debtor\n\nwhose wages are subject to a wage\nwithholding order under this section,\nmay, at any time, request a review by\nthe agency of the amount garnished,\nbased on materially changed\ncircumstances such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness which\nresult in financial hardship.(2) A debtor requesting a review\nunder paragraph (k)(1) of this section\nshall submit the basis for claiming that\nthe current amount of garnishment\nresults in a financial hardship to the\ndebtor, along with supporting\ndocumentation.Agencies shall consider\nany information submitted in\naccordance with procedures and\nstandards established by the agency.(3) If a financial hardship is found,\nthe agency shall downwardly adjust, by\nan amount and for a period of time\nagreeable to the agency, the amount\ngarnished to reflect the debtor’s\nfinancial condition.The agency will\nnotify the employer of any adjustments\nto the amounts to be withheld. (l) Ending garnishment.(1) Once the\nagency has fully recovered the amounts\nowed by the debtor, including interest,\npenalties, and administrative costs\nconsistent with the FCCS, the agency\nshall send the debtor’s employer\nnotification to discontinue wage\nwithholding.(2) At least annually, an agency shall\n\nreview its debtors’ accounts to ensure\nthat garnishment has been terminated\nfor accounts that have been paid in full.(m) Actions prohibited by the\nemployer.An employer may not\ndischarge, refuse to employ, or take\ndisciplinary action against the debtor\ndue to the issuance of a withholding\norder under this section. (n) Refunds.(1) If a hearing official, at\n\na hearing held pursuant to paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section, determines that a\ndebt is not legally due and owing to the\nUnited States, the agency shall promptly\nrefund any amount collected by means\nof administrative wage garnishment.(2) Unless required by Federal law or\n\ncontract, refunds under this section\nshall not bear interest. (o) Right of action.The agency may\nsue any employer for any amount that\nthe employer fails to withhold from\nwages owed and payable to an employee\nin accordance with paragraphs (g) and\n(i) of this section.However, a suit may\nnot be filed before the termination of the\ncollection action involving a particular\ndebtor, unless earlier filing is necessary\nto avoid expiration of any applicable\nstatute of limitations period.For\npurposes of this section, ‘‘termination of\nthe collection action’’ occurs when the\nagency has terminated collection action\nin accordance with the FCCS or other\napplicable standards.In any event,\ntermination of the collection action will\nhave been deemed to occur if the agency\nhas not received any payments to satisfy\nthe debt from the particular debtor\nwhose wages were subject to\ngarnishment, in whole or in part, for a\nperiod of one (1) year.Dated: April 30, 1998.

Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.For hearing requests\nthat are not received in the specified\ntime frame, an agency need not delay\nissuance of the withholding order prior\nto conducting a hearing.An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.It is important to note that\nEducation’s wage garnishment program\nis applicable to the collection of one\ntype of debt subject to a single statutory\nscheme.The DCIA wage garnishment\nprovision and this rule, on the other\nhand, are applicable to all Federal\nagencies collecting all types of debt, the\ncollection of which is subject to a\nvariety of statutory provisions.Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.NPRM § 285.11(b) Scope\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\nincorrectly interpreted the DCIA in the\nNPRM by not limiting the applicability\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25137\n\nof administrative wage garnishment to\nthe collection of only those debts\nevidenced by written agreements.The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.Agencies should\nseek legal advice from their agency\ncounsel to determine whether existing\nagency procedures meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand whether the agency is required to\npublish new or amended regulations.Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.Several comments addressed the\nhearing procedures proposed in the\nNPRM.FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.NPRM § 285.11(g) Wage Garnishment\nOrder\n\nOne commenter noted that the\nprovision under NPRM § 285.11(g)\nrequiring agencies to submit a wage\ngarnishment order to a debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days of a hearing\ndecision (or within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing) should be reconciled with the\n20 day period provided under\nEducation’s wage garnishment\n\nregulation at 34 CFR 682.410(b)(10)(H).The\ntime period in this rule accommodates\na broad range of agencies’ requirements\nand is consistent with the goal of\nissuing a wage garnishment order\npromptly after notice and an\nopportunity to be heard have been\nprovided to the debtor.The final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(g)(2) be amended to delete the\nrequirement that the wage garnishment\norder be signed by the head of the\nagency or his/her designee.The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.Failure to include a signature on\na wage withholding order could result\nin employer uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the order and could result in\ndelay, and possible loss, of garnishment\npayments to which the Government is\nentitled.This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.It is anticipated that a\n‘‘reasonable period of time’’ generally\nwill mean that the employer will\ncommence withholdings within two pay\ncycles following receipt of the\ngarnishment order.This may vary given\nan employer’s circumstances.This section provides\n\nprocedures for Federal agencies to\ncollect money from a debtor’s\n\n\f25140\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\ndisposable pay by means of\nadministrative wage garnishment to\nsatisfy delinquent nontax debt owed to\nthe United States. (b) Scope.(1) This section applies to\nany Federal agency that administers a\nprogram that gives rise to a delinquent\nnontax debt owed to the United States\nand to any agency that pursues recovery\nof such debt.(2) This section shall apply\n\nnotwithstanding any provision of State\nlaw.(3) Nothing in this section precludes\n\nthe compromise of a debt or the\nsuspension or termination of collection\naction in accordance with applicable\nlaw.(4) The receipt of payments pursuant\n\nto this section does not preclude a\nFederal agency from pursuing other debt\ncollection remedies, including the offset\nof Federal payments to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.(6) Nothing in this section requires\n\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.For purposes\nof this section, agency means either the\nagency that administers the program\nthat gave rise to the debt or the agency\nthat pursues recovery of the debt.Business day means Monday through\n\nFriday.For purposes of computation,\nthe last day of the period will be\nincluded unless it is a Federal legal\nholiday.Certificate of service means a\n\ncertificate signed by an agency official\nindicating the nature of the document to\nwhich it pertains, the date of mailing of\nthe document, and to whom the\ndocument is being sent.Day means calendar day. For\n\npurposes of computation, the last day of\nthe period will be included unless it is\n\na Saturday, a Sunday, or a Federal legal\nholiday.Debt or claim means any amount of\nmoney, funds or property that has been\ndetermined by an appropriate official of\nthe Federal Government to be owed to\nthe United States by an individual,\nincluding debt administered by a third\nparty as an agent for the Federal\nGovernment.Delinquent nontax debt\nmeans any nontax debt that has not\nbeen paid by the date specified in the\nagency’s initial written demand for\npayment, or applicable agreement,\nunless other satisfactory payment\narrangements have been made.For\npurposes of this section, the terms\n‘‘debt’’ and ‘‘claim’’ are synonymous\nand refer to delinquent nontax debt.Debtor means an individual who owes\n\na delinquent nontax debt to the United\nStates.Disposable pay means that part of the\n\ndebtor’s compensation (including, but\nnot limited to, salary, bonuses,\ncommissions, and vacation pay) from an\nemployer remaining after the deduction\nof health insurance premiums and any\namounts required by law to be withheld.For purposes of this section, ‘‘amounts\nrequired by law to be withheld’’ include\namounts for deductions such as social\nsecurity taxes and withholding taxes,\nbut do not include any amount withheld\npursuant to a court order.Employer means a person or entity\nthat employs the services of others and\nthat pays their wages or salaries.The\nterm employer includes, but is not\nlimited to, State and local Governments,\nbut does not include an agency of the\nFederal Government.Withholding order means any order\nfor withholding or garnishment of pay\nissued by an agency, or judicial or\nadministrative body.For purposes of\nthis section, the terms ‘‘wage\ngarnishment order’’ and ‘‘garnishment\norder’’ have the same meaning as\n‘‘withholding order.’’\n\n(d) General rule.(1) At least 30\ndays before the initiation of garnishment\nproceedings, the agency shall mail, by\nfirst class mail, to the debtor’s last\nknown address a written notice\ninforming the debtor of:\n\n(i) The nature and amount of the debt;\n\n(ii) The intention of the agency to\ninitiate proceedings to collect the debt\nthrough deductions from pay until the\ndebt and all accumulated interest,\npenalties and administrative costs are\npaid in full; and\n\n(iii) An explanation of the debtor’s\n\nrights, including those set forth in\nparagraph (e)(2) of this section, and the\ntime frame within which the debtor may\nexercise his or her rights.(2) The debtor shall be afforded the\n\nopportunity:\n\n(i) To inspect and copy agency\n\nrecords related to the debt;\n\n(ii) To enter into a written repayment\nagreement with the agency under terms\nagreeable to the agency; and\n\n(iii) For a hearing in accordance with\nparagraph (f) of this section concerning\nthe existence or the amount of the debt\nor the terms of the proposed repayment\nschedule under the garnishment order.However, the debtor is not entitled to a\nhearing concerning the terms of the\nproposed repayment schedule if these\nterms have been established by written\nagreement under paragraph (e)(2)(ii) of\nthis section.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the notice.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes. (f) Hearing—(1) In general.The agency\nshall provide a hearing, which at the\nagency’s option may be oral or written,\nif the debtor submits a written request\nfor a hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt or the terms of the\nrepayment schedule (for repayment\nschedules established other than by\nwritten agreement under paragraph\n(e)(2)(ii)) of this section.(i) For\npurposes of this section, whenever an\nagency is required to afford a debtor a\nhearing, the agency shall provide the\ndebtor with a reasonable opportunity for\nan oral hearing when the agency\ndetermines that the issues in dispute\ncannot be resolved by review of the\ndocumentary evidence, for example,\nwhen the validity of the claim turns on\nthe issue of credibility or veracity.(6) Hearing official. A hearing official\n\nmay be any qualified individual, as\ndetermined by the head of the agency,\nincluding an administrative law judge. (7) Procedure.After the debtor\n\nrequests a hearing, the hearing official\nshall notify the debtor of:\n\n(i) The date and time of a telephonic\n\nhearing;\n\n(ii) The date, time, and location of an\n\nin-person oral hearing; or\n\n(iii) The deadline for the submission\n\nof evidence for a written hearing.(ii) Thereafter, if the debtor disputes\nthe existence or amount of the debt, the\ndebtor must present by a preponderance\nof the evidence that no debt exists or\nthat the amount of the debt is incorrect.In addition, the debtor may present\nevidence that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule are unlawful,\nwould cause a financial hardship to the\n\ndebtor, or that collection of the debt\nmay not be pursued due to operation of\nlaw.(9) Record. The hearing official must\n\nmaintain a summary record of any\nhearing provided under this section.A\nhearing is not required to be a formal\nevidentiary-type hearing, however,\nwitnesses who testify in oral hearings\nwill do so under oath or affirmation. (10) Date of decision.If an agency is unable to provide\nthe debtor with a hearing and render a\ndecision within 60 days after the receipt\nof the request for such hearing:\n\n(i) The agency may not issue a\n\nwithholding order until the hearing is\nheld and a decision rendered; or\n\n(ii) If the agency had previously\nissued a withholding order to the\ndebtor’s employer, the agency must\nsuspend the withholding order\nbeginning on the 61st day after the\nreceipt of the hearing request and\ncontinuing until a hearing is held and\na decision is rendered.(12) Final agency action. The hearing\n\nofficial’s decision will be the final\nagency action for the purposes of\njudicial review under the\nAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C.701 et seq.). (13) Failure to appear.In the absence\nof good cause shown, a debtor who fails\nto appear at a hearing scheduled\npursuant to paragraph (f)(4) of this\nsection will be deemed as not having\ntimely filed a request for a hearing. (g) Wage garnishment order.(2) The withholding order sent to the\nemployer under paragraph (g)(1) of this\nsection shall be in a form prescribed by\nthe Secretary of the Treasury on the\n\nagency’s letterhead and signed by the\nhead of the agency or his/her delegatee.The order shall contain only the\ninformation necessary for the employer\nto comply with the withholding order.Such information includes the debtor’s\nname, address, and social security\nnumber, as well as instructions for\nwithholding and information as to\nwhere payments should be sent.(3) The agency will keep a copy of a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof mailing of the order.The certificate\nof service may be retained electronically\nso long as the manner of retention is\nsufficient for evidentiary purposes.(h) Certification by employer.Along\nwith the withholding order, the agency\nshall send to the employer a\ncertification in a form prescribed by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.The employer\nshall complete and return the\ncertification to the agency within the\ntime frame prescribed in the\ninstructions to the form.The\ncertification will address matters such\nas information about the debtor’s\nemployment status and disposable pay\navailable for withholding. (i) Amounts withheld.(1) After receipt\n\nof the garnishment order issued under\nthis section, the employer shall deduct\nfrom all disposable pay paid to the\napplicable debtor during each pay\nperiod the amount of garnishment\ndescribed in paragraph (i)(2) of this\nsection.1673(a)(2) is the amount by which a\ndebtor’s disposable pay exceeds an\namount equivalent to thirty times the\nminimum wage. See 29 CFR 870.10.(3) When a debtor’s pay is subject to\n\nwithholding orders with priority the\nfollowing shall apply:\n\n(i) Unless otherwise provided by\nFederal law, withholding orders issued\nunder this section shall be paid in the\namounts set forth under paragraph (i)(2)\nof this section and shall have priority\nover other withholding orders which are\nserved later in time.Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, withholding orders for\nfamily support shall have priority over\nwithholding orders issued under this\nsection.(ii) If amounts are being withheld\n\nfrom a debtor’s pay pursuant to a\nwithholding order served on an\nemployer before a withholding order\n\n\f25142\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nissued pursuant to this section, or if a\nwithholding order for family support is\nserved on an employer at any time, the\namounts withheld pursuant to the\nwithholding order issued under this\nsection shall be the lesser of:\n\n(A) The amount calculated under\n\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section, or\n\n(B) An amount equal to 25% of the\n\ndebtor’s disposable pay less the\namount(s) withheld under the\nwithholding order(s) with priority.(iii) If a debtor owes more than one\ndebt to an agency, the agency may issue\nmultiple withholding orders provided\nthat the total amount garnished from the\ndebtor’s pay for such orders does not\nexceed the amount set forth in\nparagraph (i)(2) of this section.For\npurposes of this paragraph (i)(3)(iii), the\nterm agency refers to the agency that is\nowed the debt.(7) Any assignment or allotment by an\n\nemployee of his earnings shall be void\nto the extent it interferes with or\nprohibits execution of the withholding\norder issued under this section, except\nfor any assignment or allotment made\npursuant to a family support judgment\nor order.(8) The employer shall withhold the\nappropriate amount from the debtor’s\nwages for each pay period until the\nemployer receives notification from the\nagency to discontinue wage\nwithholding.The debtor has the burden of\ninforming the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. (k) Financial hardship.(1) A debtor\n\nwhose wages are subject to a wage\nwithholding order under this section,\nmay, at any time, request a review by\nthe agency of the amount garnished,\nbased on materially changed\ncircumstances such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness which\nresult in financial hardship.Agencies shall consider\nany information submitted in\naccordance with procedures and\nstandards established by the agency.(3) If a financial hardship is found,\nthe agency shall downwardly adjust, by\nan amount and for a period of time\nagreeable to the agency, the amount\ngarnished to reflect the debtor’s\nfinancial condition.The agency will\nnotify the employer of any adjustments\nto the amounts to be withheld. (l) Ending garnishment.(1) Once the\nagency has fully recovered the amounts\nowed by the debtor, including interest,\npenalties, and administrative costs\nconsistent with the FCCS, the agency\nshall send the debtor’s employer\nnotification to discontinue wage\nwithholding.(2) At least annually, an agency shall\n\nreview its debtors’ accounts to ensure\nthat garnishment has been terminated\nfor accounts that have been paid in full.(m) Actions prohibited by the\nemployer.An employer may not\ndischarge, refuse to employ, or take\ndisciplinary action against the debtor\ndue to the issuance of a withholding\norder under this section. (n) Refunds.(1) If a hearing official, at\n\na hearing held pursuant to paragraph\n(f)(3) of this section, determines that a\ndebt is not legally due and owing to the\nUnited States, the agency shall promptly\nrefund any amount collected by means\nof administrative wage garnishment.(2) Unless required by Federal law or\n\ncontract, refunds under this section\nshall not bear interest. (o) Right of action.The agency may\nsue any employer for any amount that\nthe employer fails to withhold from\nwages owed and payable to an employee\nin accordance with paragraphs (g) and\n(i) of this section.However, a suit may\nnot be filed before the termination of the\ncollection action involving a particular\ndebtor, unless earlier filing is necessary\nto avoid expiration of any applicable\nstatute of limitations period.For\npurposes of this section, ‘‘termination of\nthe collection action’’ occurs when the\nagency has terminated collection action\nin accordance with the FCCS or other\napplicable standards.In any event,\ntermination of the collection action will\nhave been deemed to occur if the agency\nhas not received any payments to satisfy\nthe debt from the particular debtor\nwhose wages were subject to\ngarnishment, in whole or in part, for a\nperiod of one (1) year.Dated: April 30, 1998.

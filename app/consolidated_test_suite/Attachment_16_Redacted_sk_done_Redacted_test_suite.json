records are kept confidential by the Board and no information about the personnel records is \nprovided to the public during the investigation.However, if the investigation reveals improper actions by \nthe licensee (consumer), the Board may take action to limit or even revoke the professional license.Personnel records may become part of the official proceedings.Even then, efforts can be made to protect \nthe privacy of those records.Consumers may consent to have the Board obtain and review their personnel records by signing the \n“Authorization For Release” form (enclosed).This form also authorizes the Board and the California \nDepartment of Justice, Office of the Attorney General to use the records as evidence in any official \nproceeding against a licensee.However, in that case, the \nBoard may take the necessary steps to subpoena the records.By signing the enclosed “Authorization For Release” form, you assist the Board in its effort to investigate \nwhether practices fell below the standards required by law.Your cooperation provides a valuable public \nservice.INV99-02 (rev 13) \n \n \n\n BUSINESS, CONSUMER SERVICES, AND HOUSING AGENCY   •   GOVERNOR GAVIN NEWSOM \f\f

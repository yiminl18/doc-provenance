individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019,

based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.KEYWORDS \nSelf-tracking,  Commuting,

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.KEYWORDS \nSelf-tracking,  Commuting,

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.(2016).

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.KEYWORDS \nSelf-tracking,  Commuting,

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the

impact of human \nactivities  on  the  environment  [2,  21,  22]  and  promoting  change \nof practices to become more sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <,

among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities

related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model

reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take

September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].We describe our findings in next section.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where

limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.KEYWORDS \nSelf-tracking,  Commuting,

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.Watch \nyour Emissions: Persuasive Strategies and Choice Architecture for Sustainable \nDecisions in Urban Mobility.",

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.their

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.KEYWORDS \nSelf-tracking,  Commuting,

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.Qualitative research in psychology, 3 (2), 77-101.Journal  of  Public \nTransportation, 17 (2), 2.[9]  Bucher,  D.,  Cellina,  F.,  Mangili,  F.,  Raubal,  M.,  Rudel,  R.,  Rizzoli,  A.

environment  [2,  21,  22]  and  promoting  change \nof practices to become more sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.KEYWORDS \nSelf-tracking,  Commuting,

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019,

based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.KEYWORDS \nSelf-tracking,  Commuting,

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom

emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.We identified

to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto

users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective

C. (2014, April).Personal \ntracking  as  lived  informatics.interactions, 21 (5), 66-69. [22]  Thatcher,  A.There is a category of situations where individuals encounter \ndifficulties in understanding data.It is possible that data are hard \nto  grasp  because  even  the  basic  units  that  are  used  are  too \nabstract and far from a known reference.The second level relates more to the notion of accepting the \ndata.For  that,  the  study  show  that  people  need  to  make  a \ncomparison between the gathered figures and the representation \nthey  have  of  themselves  in  their  practices,  commuting  in  our \ncase.If  there  is  a  gap  between  the  figures  given  and  their  self-\nrepresentation,  the  participants,  expressed  misunderstanding \nand also judged the figures as being unfair.A main reason why the eco-calculator model was leading to \ninconsistencies  was  that  there  was  an  implicit  intent  that  the \nmodel  should  have  supported  explicitly  [18]  and  that  we \ndiscovered  was  not  doing  that  so  well.The  intent  of  the  eco-\ncalculator  was  to  support  the  adoption  of  greener  practices.What appeared as an outcome was that, for several participants, \nthe use of the bus led to more CO2 emissions than car-sharing or \nmoped.This  conclusion  would  be  very  likely  in  opposition  to \nwhat  public  authorities  and  common  sense  perceive  as  green \ntransportation  practices.Either \ninadequately \ncomputes the CO2 emissions for feedback at an individual level, \neither  car-sharing \nthan  public \nit  would  be  worth  to \ntransportation  and \nacknowledge that and act accordingly.is \nreally \nin  that  case \n\nless  polluting \n\nthe  model \n\nWe believe that this work can be inspiring for the quantified-\nself  community  about  ways  to  answer  to  the  need  to  better \ncontextualize tracked data [6].The results of this study are very \nspecific,  but  the  highlighted  issues  raised  in  this  paper  are \ndirectly  aligned  with  the  current  open  questions  on  the \n“Explainable, Accountable and Intelligible Systems” [1].There is \na  need  to  provide  users  with  tools  for  understanding  the \nunderlying  models  or  algorithms  supporting  decision-making \nprocesses or figures that directly target them.REFERENCES \n[1]  Abdul, A., Vermeulen, J., Wang, D., Lim, B.

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.In  the  results,  we  describe  situations  where  users \neither misunderstood or did not accept the data and the models \nutilized  to  represent  them,  highlighting  a  limitation  that  diary \ninstruments (and underlying models) of this type would have in \nsupporting  people  to  reflect  upon  and  possibly  change  their \nmobility choices.KEYWORDS \nSelf-tracking,  Commuting,

sustainable [13].The  use  of  personal  informatics,  also  referred  as  quantified-\nself  or  self-tracking,  is  today  made  possible  by  the  variety  of \ntools and connected objects that are available to individuals and \nhas  been  widely  analyzed in  the  HCI  research  community  [20].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Based  on  the  collected  data  and \non  the  change  that  the  user  wants  to  achieve,  personal \ninformatics  support  the  user  by  tracking  progress  toward  a \ndesired direction.Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the \nnumber  of  steps,  the  quality  of  sleep,  the  heart  pulsation  or \nburned calories.The majority of self-tracking practices target the \ndomain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly \nsimple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and the \nnumber  of  calories  burned.Despite  the  required  low  level  of \nknowledge  and  relative  simplicity  of  the  underlying  models, \nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may \nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the \ntrackers [12, 15].When  considering  the  sustainable  mobility  domain,  we  can \nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even \nincrease,  since  the  phenomena  are  much  more  complex  and \ndifficult  to  reduce.If  a  user  commutes  with  her  car  every  day, \nhow  are  we going  to  compute  a  fixed  amount  of  money  that is \nspent  each  day  to  go  to  work  by  driving  a  car?Should  we \ninclude the initial cost of acquiring a car?The annual insurance \nfee? The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong \n\n \n\n \n\n144\fECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n \nimpact  on  decision  making  for  taking  one  or  another  means  of \ntransport.Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

The  costs  of  maintenance?If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the \nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of \ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day, \nwe  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to \ncommute.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport, \nquestioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles \nindividuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and \npotentially their privileges) vis-à-vis a global problem.But to do \nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize \nthe  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall \nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan \narea, the country, etc.).Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is \nused  to  commute  either  with  car-sharing,  or  by  bus  or  by  car \n\n \n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom \n\nsolo.According  to  the  eco-calculator  model  used  in  the  study, \nthe greener option was car-sharing.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.3.2.2  Challenging self-representations.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,

individuals  with  tools  that \nsupport  behavior  change  toward  greener  practices,  as  for \nexample  in  commuting.This  paper  illustrates  the  results  of  a \nstudy that we conducted on the effectiveness of self-tracking of \ncommuting  data  where  participants  received  daily  feedback  on \nthe financial costs and CO2 emissions associated to their mobility \npractices.Copyrights for

sustainable [13].One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change \nmanagement  [17].The  link  between  self-tracking  and  change \nmanagement  is  in  the  reflexive  position  that  users  can  adopt \nregarding  their  behaviors  [19].Current  online  tools  for  eco-feedback  on  mobility  are  based \non  disaggregated  data  among  the  various  means  of  transport \n[10].This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our \nparticipants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers, \ncomputer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and \nsales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen \nand paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to \nindicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the \nreason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the \nparticipants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to \ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of \ntheir commuting.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e.is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this \nwould  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of \nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10 \nwho  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of \ntransport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.“So in the end the combination \nbus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I \ndon’t  understand.”  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he \nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own \nrepresentation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only \nunderstandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also \nperceived  as  fair.The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”.This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.To  go  further,  P10  added:  “yeah the thing about the bus is that \nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is \nthere  regardless  and  you  do  not  directly  emit  anything.”  Which \nexpressed  the  gap  between  a  global  representation  this \nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily \nfeedback at an individual level.The  previous  example \nshows  that  an  oversimplified  and  incomplete  model  can  create \nconfusion  on  the relationship  between individual  and  collective \nmeans  of  transport  and  one’s  individual  impact  on  CO2 \nis  particularly \nemissions  within \nproblematic  given  that  one  of  the  explicit  goals  of  this  type  of \ntool  is  to  help  people  challenge  their  self-representation  and \ntheir habits.their  community. This \n\nThe  potential  consequences  of  a  naïve  or  uninformed \nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction \nof  participant  P8,  working  at  almost  40  km  from  her  place  and \nhighly  motivated  in  reducing  her  environmental  footprint.So, \nwhen  during  the  second  interview  the  researcher  explained  to \nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of CO2 per day and that it \nwas quite high compared to other participants, she  said: “I don’t \nunderstand,  I  only  take  the  train  and  ride  my  bike.”  In  her \nrepresentation,  P8  only  considered  the  type  of  means  of \ntransport  to  assess  if  it  produced  a  high  or  low  impact  on  the \nenvironment.She  had  put  aside  the  fact  that  when you live  far \nfrom  your  workplace,  the  CO2  emissions  due  to  transport  are \nnecessarily  higher.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.4  Discussion and Conclusion \nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where \ndata  of  self-behaviors  put  the  users  at  unease.The  difficulties \nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n146\fCecile Boulard et al.[6]  Boulard-Masson,  C.,  Colombino,  T.,  &  Grasso,  A.

The  costs  of  maintenance?Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip.How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?This  means  that  for  any  mode  of  transport  and  a  given \ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of CO2 emission that are \nassociated  (for  instance  an  average  CO2  emission  per  distance \nand  per  passenger  for  public  transport).However,  as  the \ncomputation  is  complex  and  is  based  on  a  range  of  factors \n(owning  a  car,  having  a  public  transport  monthly  pass,  ride-\nsharing),  it  is  difficult  for  a  person  to  construct  an  accurate \npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices  [3, 8, \n23].There  are  studies  on  tools  supporting  greener  mobility \npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none \nof  them  details  and  discusses  the  model  underlying  the \ncomputation.This  paper  aims  at  contributing  to  the  body  of \nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type \nof data.2  Method and Settings \nIn  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of \nCO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has \nbeen  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is \ndifficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through \nobservation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a \nsnowball  sampling.The  first \none  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed \ninterview  with  the \nparticipants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting \npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing \na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that \nthey  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the \nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives \nfor commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2 \nemission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical \ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the \nstudy  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the \npaper.We also shared with the participants a representation \n\n \n\nCecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the \nfigures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were \npresented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required \nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal \nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the \ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those \nfigures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and \nchoices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants’ \ndiary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and \nanalyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a \nthematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified \nthemes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities \nrepresentation  of \nrather \nunderstanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing \n\nthan  having \n\n3  Findings \nDuring  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to \nthe  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in \nunderstanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their \ncommuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and \npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it \nto measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even \nwithin  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards \nquestioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits, \nthere  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and \npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into \nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices \nvis-a-vis \nthem \nspecifically.transportation  options  available \n\nthe \n\nto \n\nThe findings that we report here come from the last phase of \nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to \nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data \n3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12], \nwhen  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the \ncontext  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of \nthem.This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in \ncontextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative) \nscale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the \nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.This can be \nan  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the \nmodel  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting \n\n145\f“I Don’t Understand…” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting \n \nfinancial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was \nmainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and \nonly  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the \ncosts  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  “I \nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was \nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7) \n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned \nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by \nthe  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived \nas not complete.As  she \nexplained:  “then  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine \nthe  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the \nworking days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the \nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit \nwith  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it \nmeant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in \nthe  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been \ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.After this feedback, the researcher had to \nexplain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in \nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the \ncombination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As \nthe  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than \n8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the \ncost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The \nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of \nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and \ndriving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data \n3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The \nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices \nwith  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its \nrole,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of \ntransport.The  data  allowed  the  participant  to  realize \nthat  she  had  a  biased  understanding  of  the  environmental \nfootprint.But while in this case the CO2 measurement provided \nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part \nof  the  researcher  to  contextualize  the  data  to  this  person’s \nspecific situation.A.

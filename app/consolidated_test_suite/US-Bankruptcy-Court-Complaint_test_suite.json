Debtors even provided Defendant with business cards reflecting his position \n\nas a “Principal” with Americore Health to assist his financing efforts.A redacted copy of the \n\nDefendant’s  business  card  is  attached  as  Exhibit  B.As  a  result,  Defendant  became  a \n\nfiduciary to Americore Health. 17.Instead,  of  complying  with  his  fiduciary  responsibilities,  Defendant  helped \n\nDebtors procure an ill-advised bridge loan from a hedge fund that had a deleterious impact \n\non the financial affairs of the Debtor and ultimately forced Debtors into bankruptcy, as he \n\nnever delivered the promised the large investment from the Middle East.18. And worse, Defendant never repaid the Loans to Americore Health, including \n\nduring the time that Debtors were strapped for cash.19. Despite Trustee’s demand, Defendant has still failed and refused to return the \n\nTransfers to the Trustee.COUNT I \n(Fraudulent Transfers pursuant to \nSection 548(a)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code) \n\n20.Trustee incorporates the allegations in paragraphs 1 - 19 as if set forth fully \n\nherein.4 \n\n\fCase 22-06032-grs    Doc 1    Filed 07/07/22    Entered 07/07/22 12:58:00    Desc Main\nDocument      Page 5 of 16\n\n21.Within two years of the Petition Date, that is between January 12, 2018 and \n\nJune 4, 2018, Americore Health made the Transfers to Defendant.22. The Transfers constituted the transfer of an interest of Americore Health in \n\nproperty. 23.Americore  Health  received  less  than  reasonably  equivalent  value  in \n\nexchange for each of the Transfers, and: \n\na.Was  insolvent  on  the  dates  that  such  transfers  were  made,  or \n\nbecame insolvent as a result of such transfers; \n\nb.Was engaged in business or a transaction or was about to engage \n\nin  business or  a transaction for  which  any  property  remaining  with \n\nAmericore Health was an unreasonably small capital; or \n\nc. \n\nAmericore Health intended to incur, or believed that it would incur, \n\ndebts that would be beyond its ability to pay as such debts matured.WHEREFORE, the Plaintiff respectfully requests the Court to enter a Judgment:\n\na. \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\nd. \n\nDeclaring the Transfers to have been fraudulent transfers pursuant \nto Section 548(a)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code; \n\nAvoiding  the  Transfers  made  to  the  Defendant  as  fraudulent \ntransfers under Section 548(a)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code; \n\nDisallowing  any  claim  that  the  Defendant  may  have  against  the \nDebtor; \n\nRequiring  Defendant  to  repay  the  Transfers  to  the  Plaintiff,  plus \ninterest; and \n\ne. \n\nGranting such other and further relief as may be just and proper.5 \n\n\fCase 22-06032-grs    Doc 1    Filed 07/07/22    Entered 07/07/22 12:58:00    Desc Main\nDocument      Page 6 of 16\n\nCOUNT II \n(Turnover of Property of the Estate – 11 U.S.C.§ 542) \n\n24.

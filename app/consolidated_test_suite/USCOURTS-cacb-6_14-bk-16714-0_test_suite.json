and debts for death or personal injury caused by operating a motorvehicle, vessel, or aircraft while intoxicated from alcohol or drugs.Also, if a creditor can prove that a debt arose fromfraud, breach of fiduciary duty, or theft, or from a willful and malicious injury, the bankruptcy court may determine thatthe debt is not discharged.Chapter 13: Repayment of All or Part of the Debts of an Individual with Regular Income ($235 filing fee,$46 administrative fee: Total fee $281)1.Chapter 13 is designed for individuals with regular income who would like to pay all or part of their debts in installmentsover a period of time.The period allowed by the court to repay your debts may be three years or five years,depending upon your income and other factors.The court must approve your plan before it can take effect.3.After completing the payments under your plan, your debts are generally discharged except for domestic supportobligations; most student loans; certain taxes; most criminal fines and restitution obligations; certain debts which are notproperly listed in your bankruptcy papers; certain debts for acts that caused death or personal injury; and certain longterm secured obligations.Chapter 11: Reorganization ($1,167 filing fee, $46 administrative fee: Total fee $1,213)Chapter 11 is designed for the reorganization of a business but is also available to consumer debtors.Its provisions are quitecomplicated, and any decision by an individual to file a chapter 11 petition should be reviewed with an attorney.Chapter 12: Family Farmer or Fisherman ($200 filing fee, $46 administrative fee: Total fee $246)Chapter 12 is designed to permit family farmers and fishermen to repay their debts over a period of time from future earningsand is similar to chapter 13.The eligibility requirements are restrictive, limiting its use to those whose income arises primarilyfrom a family-owned farm or commercial fishing operation.3.Bankruptcy Crimes and Availability of Bankruptcy Papers to Law Enforcement OfficialsA person who knowingly and fraudulently conceals assets or makes a false oath or statement under penalty of perjury, eitherorally or in writing, in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to a fine, imprisonment, or both.All information suppliedby a debtor in connection with a bankruptcy case is subject to examination by the Attorney General acting through the Officeof the United States Trustee, the Office of the United States Attorney, and other components and employees of theDepartment of Justice.WARNING:Section 521(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that you promptly file detailed information regarding your creditors,assets, liabilities, income, expenses and general financial condition.Your bankruptcy case may be dismissed if this information is notfiled with the court within the time deadlines set by the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, and the local rules of the court.Certificate of the DebtorI (We), the debtor(s), affirm that I (we) have received and read this notice.Alejandra G MontoyaX/s/ Alejandra G MontoyaMay 22, 2014Printed Name(s) of Debtor(s)Signature of DebtorDateCase No.(if known)XSignature of Joint Debtor (if any)Date\fCase 6:14-bk-16714-WJ    Doc 1    Filed 05/22/14    Entered 05/22/14 03:41:27    Desc\n Main Document      Page 9 of 56\n\n}bk1{Form 6.Summary of Schedules}bk{United States Bankruptcy CourtCentral District of CaliforniaIn re,DebtorCase No.Chapter7Alejandra G MontoyaB 6 Summary (Official Form 6 - Summary) (12/13)Indicate as to each schedule whether that schedule is attached and state the number of pages in each.Add the amounts from Schedules A and B to determine the total amount of the debtor’s assets.Add the amounts of all claims from Schedules D, E, and F to determine the total amount of the debtor’s liabilities.OFNAME OF SCHEDULEASSETSLIABILITIESOTHER(YES/NO)SHEETSA - Real PropertyB - Personal PropertyC - Property Claimed as ExemptD - Creditors Holding Secured ClaimsE - Creditors Holding UnsecuredPriority ClaimsF - Creditors Holding UnsecuredNonpriority ClaimsG - Executory Contracts andUnexpired LeasesH - CodebtorsI -Current Income of IndividualDebtor(s)J -Current Expenditures of IndividualDebtor(s)Total Number of Sheets of ALL SchedulesTotal AssetsTotal Liabilities(Total of Claims on Schedule E)Software Copyright (c) 1996-2013 - Best Case, LLC - www.bestcase.comBest Case BankruptcyYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYesYes10.0036,230.0010.0010.00296,781.0051122,400.0022,535.00196,230.0096,781.00\fCase 6:14-bk-16714-WJ    Doc 1    Filed 05/22/14    Entered 05/22/14 03:41:27    Desc\n Main Document      Page 10 of 56\n\n}bk1{Form 6.Statistical Summary of Certain Liabilities and Related Data}bk{United States Bankruptcy CourtCentral District of CaliforniaIn re,DebtorCase No.Chapter7Alejandra G MontoyaB 6 Summary (Official Form 6 - Summary) (12/13)STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF CERTAIN LIABILITIES AND RELATED DATA (28 U.S.C.You are not required to report any information here.This information is for statistical purposes only under 28 U.S.C.§ 159.Summarize the following types of liabilities, as reported in the Schedules, and total them.Type of LiabilityAmountDomestic Support Obligations (from Schedule E)Taxes and Certain Other Debts Owed to Governmental Units (from Schedule E)Claims for Death or Personal Injury While Debtor Was Intoxicated(from Schedule E) (whether disputed or undisputed)Student Loan Obligations (from Schedule F)Domestic Support, Separation Agreement, and Divorce DecreeObligations Not Reported on Schedule EObligations to Pension or Profit-Sharing, and Other Similar Obligations(from Schedule F)TOTALState the following:Average Income (from Schedule I, Line 12)Average Expenses (from Schedule J, Line 22)Current Monthly Income (from Form 22A Line 12;

Form 1040-NR filers.You must file Form 4868 by the regular \ndue date of the return.If you didn’t receive wages as an employee subject to U.S. \nincome tax withholding, and your return is due June 16, 2025, \ncheck the box on line 9.For more information on extensions for nonresident filers, see \n\nPub.519, U.S. Tax Guide for Aliens.However, there may be an exception if you’re living out of the \ncountry.If your return is more than 60 days \nlate, the minimum penalty is $510 (adjusted for inflation) or the \nbalance of the tax due on your return, whichever is smaller.If you want correspondence regarding this extension to be sent to \n\nyou at an address other than your own, enter that address.If you \nwant the correspondence sent to an agent acting for you, include \nthe agent’s name (as well as your own) and the agent’s address.If you changed your name after you filed your last return because \n\nof marriage, divorce, etc., be sure to report this to the Social \nSecurity Administration before filing Form 4868.This prevents \ndelays in processing your extension request.If you changed your mailing address after you filed your last \n\nreturn, you should use Form 8822, Change of Address, to notify the \nIRS of the change.Showing a new address on Form 4868 won’t \nupdate your record.If you plan to file a joint return, enter on line 2 the social security \nnumber (SSN) that you’ll show first on your return.Enter on line 3 \nthe other SSN to be shown on the joint return.If you’re filing Form \n1040-NR as an estate or trust, enter your employer identification \nnumber (EIN) instead of an SSN on line 2.In the left margin, next to \nthe EIN, write “estate” or “trust.”\nIRS individual taxpayer identification numbers (ITINs) for aliens.If you’re a nonresident or resident alien and you don’t have and \naren’t eligible to get an SSN, you must apply for an ITIN.Although \nan ITIN isn’t required to file Form 4868, you’ll need one to file your \nincome tax return.If you already have an ITIN, enter it \nwherever an SSN is requested.You can round off cents to whole \ndollars on Form 4868.To round, drop amounts under 50 cents and \nincrease amounts from 50 to 99 cents to the next dollar.For \nexample, $1.39 becomes $1 and $2.50 becomes $3.If you have to \nadd two or more amounts to figure the amount to enter on a line, \ninclude cents when adding the amounts and only round off the total.Line 4—Estimate of Total Tax Liability for 2024\nEnter on line 4 the total tax liability you expect to report on your \n2024:\n• Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 24; or\n• Form 1040-SS, Part I, line 7.If you expect this amount to be zero, enter -0-. ▲!CAUTION\n\nMake your estimate as accurate as you can with the \ninformation you have.If we later find that the estimate \nwasn’t reasonable, the extension will be null and void.Line 5—Estimate of Total Payments for 2024\nEnter on line 5 the total payments you expect to report on your \n2024:\n• Form 1040, 1040-SR, or 1040-NR, line 33 (excluding Schedule 3, \nline 10); or\n• Form 1040-SS, Part I, line 12 (excluding Part I, line 11b).Don’t include on line 5 the amount you’re paying with this \nForm 4868.Line 7—Amount You’re Paying \nIf you find you can’t pay the amount shown on line 6, you can still \nget the extension.But you should pay as much as you can to limit \nthe amount of interest you’ll owe.Also, you may be charged a late \npayment penalty on the unpaid tax from the regular due date of \nyour return.See Late Payment Penalty, earlier.“Out of the country” is defined under \nTaxpayers who are out of the country, earlier.Line 9—Form 1040-NR Filers \nIf you didn’t receive wages subject to U.S. income tax withholding, \nand your return is due June 16, 2025, check the box on line 9.You’ll receive a confirmation number when \nyou pay online or by phone.Enter the confirmation number below \nand keep it for your records.Enter confirmation number here:  \nNote: If you use an electronic payment method and indicate the \npayment is for an extension, you don’t have to file Form 4868.You \nshould pay the entire estimated tax owed or you could be subject to \na penalty.Form 4868 (2024)\n\n \nIf you live in: \n\nWhere To File a Paper Form 4868\n\nPage 4 \n\nAnd you’re making a payment,  \nsend Form 4868 with your payment to \nInternal Revenue Service: \n\nAnd you’re not making a payment, \nsend Form 4868 to \nDepartment of the Treasury, \nInternal Revenue Service Center: \n\nP.O.Box 1302, Charlotte, NC 28201-1302\n\nAustin, TX 73301-0045\n\nArizona, New Mexico\n\nP.O.Box 931300, Louisville, KY 40293-1300\n\nKansas City, MO 64999-0045\n\nP.O.Box 931300, Louisville, KY 40293-1300\n\nAustin, TX 73301-0045\n\nP.O.Box 802503, Cincinnati, OH 45280-2503\n\nKansas City, MO 64999-0045\n\nAll foreign estate and trust Form 1040-NR filers\n\nP.O.Box 1303, Charlotte, NC 28201-1303 USA \n\nKansas City, MO 64999-0045 USA \n\nAll other Form 1040-NR and 1040-SS filers\n\nP.O.Box 1303, Charlotte, NC 28201-1303 USA \n\nAustin, TX 73301-0215 USA \n\nP.O.Box 1303, Charlotte, NC 28201-1303 USA\n\nAustin, TX 73301-0215 USA \n\nAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North \nCarolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas\n\nConnecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Indiana, \nIowa, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, \nMissouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode \nIsland, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin\n\nAlaska, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, \nMontana, Nebraska, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon, \nSouth Dakota, Utah, Washington, Wyoming\n\nA foreign country, American Samoa, or Puerto Rico, or are \nexcluding income under Internal Revenue Code section 933,  \nor use an APO or FPO address, or file Form 2555 or 4563,  \nor are a dual-status alien, or nonpermanent resident of Guam or \nthe U.S. Virgin Islands\n\nPrivate Delivery Services \nYou can use certain private delivery services designated by the IRS \nto meet the “timely mailing as timely filing/paying” rule for tax \nreturns and payments.• Federal Express (FedEx): FedEx First Overnight, FedEx Priority \nOvernight, FedEx Standard Overnight, FedEx 2 Day, FedEx \nInternational Next Flight Out, FedEx International Priority, FedEx \nInternational First, and FedEx International Economy.• DHL Express: DHL Express 9:00, DHL Express 10:30, DHL \nExpress 12:00, DHL Express Worldwide, DHL Express Envelope, \nDHL Import Express 10:30, DHL Import Express 12:00, and DHL \nImport Express Worldwide.• United Parcel Service (UPS): UPS Next Day Air Early AM, UPS \nNext Day Air, UPS Next Day Air Saver, UPS 2nd Day Air, UPS 2nd \nDay Air A.M., UPS Worldwide Express Plus, and UPS Worldwide \nExpress.To check for any updates to the list of designated private delivery \n\nservices, go to www.irs.gov/PDS.We may also disclose this information to other countries under \na tax treaty, to federal and state agencies to enforce federal nontax \ncriminal laws, or to federal law enforcement and intelligence \nagencies to combat terrorism.If you fail to provide this information \nin a timely manner or provide incomplete or false information, you \nmay be liable for penalties.Books or records relating to a \nform or its instructions must be retained as long as their contents \nmay become material in the administration of any Internal Revenue \nlaw.Generally, tax returns and return information are confidential, \nas required by Internal Revenue Code section 6103.The average time and expenses required to complete and file this \n\nform will vary depending on individual circumstances.For the \nestimated averages, see the instructions for your income tax return.See the instructions for your income tax \nreturn.",

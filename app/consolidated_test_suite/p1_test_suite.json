Publication 1  (Rev.9-2017)  Catalog Number 64731W  Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service  www.irs.gov\n\n\fExaminations, Appeals, Collections, and Refunds\n\nExaminations (Audits) \nWe accept most taxpayers’ returns as filed.If we inquire about your return or select it \nfor examination, it does not suggest that \nyou are dishonest.The inquiry or \nexamination may or may not result in more \ntax.We may close your case without \nchange; or, you may receive a refund.The process of selecting a return for \nexamination usually begins in one of two \nways.First, we use computer programs to \nidentify returns that may have incorrect \namounts.These programs may be based \non information returns, such as Forms \n1099 and W-2, on studies of past \nexaminations, or on certain issues \nidentified by compliance projects.Second, \nwe use information from outside sources \nthat indicates that a return may have \nincorrect amounts.These sources may \ninclude newspapers, public records, and \nindividuals.If we determine that the \ninformation is accurate and reliable, we \nmay use it to select a return for \nexamination.Publication 556, Examination of Returns, \n\nAppeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, \nexplains the rules and procedures that we \nfollow in examinations.The following \nsections give an overview of how we \nconduct examinations.By Mail \nWe handle many examinations and \ninquiries by mail.We will send you a letter \nwith either a request for more information \nor a reason why we believe a change to \nyour return may be needed.You can \nrespond by mail or you can request a \npersonal interview with an examiner.If you \nmail us the requested information or \nprovide an explanation, we may or may not \nagree with you, and we will explain the \nreasons for any changes.Please do not \nhesitate to write to us about anything you \ndo not understand.By Interview \nIf we notify you that we will conduct your \nexamination through a personal interview, \nor you request such an interview, you have \nthe right to ask that the examination take \nplace at a reasonable time and place that is \nconvenient for both you and the IRS.If our \nexaminer proposes any changes to your \nreturn, he or she will explain the reasons for \nthe changes.If you do not agree with these \nchanges, you can meet with the examiner’s \nsupervisor.Repeat Examinations \nIf we examined your return for the same \nitems in either of the 2 previous years and \nproposed no change to your tax liability, \nplease contact us as soon as possible so \nwe can see if we should discontinue the \nexamination.Appeals\nIf you do not agree with the examiner’s \nproposed changes, you can appeal them to \n\nthe Appeals Office of the IRS.Most \ndifferences can be settled without \nexpensive and time-consuming court trials.Your appeal rights are explained in detail in \nboth Publication 5, Your Appeal Rights and \nHow To Prepare a Protest If You Don’t \nAgree, and Publication 556, Examination of \nReturns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for \nRefund.If you do not wish to use the Appeals \nOffice or disagree with its findings, you \nmay be able to take your case to the U.S. \nTax Court, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or \nthe U.S. District Court where you live.If \nyou take your case to court, the IRS will \nhave the burden of proving certain facts if \nyou kept adequate records to show your \ntax liability, cooperated with the IRS, and \nmeet certain other conditions.If the court \nagrees with you on most issues in your \ncase and finds that our position was largely \nunjustified, you may be able to recover \nsome of your administrative and litigation \ncosts.You will not be eligible to recover \nthese costs unless you tried to resolve your \ncase administratively, including going \nthrough the appeals system, and you gave \nus the information necessary to resolve the \ncase.Collections \nPublication 594, The IRS Collection \nProcess, explains your rights and \nresponsibilities regarding payment of \nfederal taxes.It describes: \n(cid:127) What to do when you owe taxes.It \n\ndescribes what to do if you get a tax bill \nand what to do if you think your bill is \nwrong.It also covers making installment \npayments, delaying collection action, \nand submitting an offer in compromise.(cid:127) IRS collection actions.It covers liens, \n\nreleasing a lien, levies, releasing a levy, \nseizures and sales, and release of \nproperty.(cid:127) IRS certification to the State Department \nof a seriously delinquent tax debt, which \nwill generally result in denial of a \npassport application and may lead to \nrevocation of a passport.Your collection appeal rights are explained \nin detail in Publication 1660, Collection \nAppeal Rights.Innocent Spouse Relief \nGenerally, both you and your spouse are \neach responsible for paying the full \namount of tax, interest, and penalties due \non your joint return.However, if you \nqualify for innocent spouse relief, you may \nbe relieved of part or all of the joint \nliability.To request relief, you must file \nForm 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse \nRelief.For more information on innocent \nspouse relief, see Publication 971, Innocent \nSpouse Relief, and Form 8857.Potential Third Party Contacts \nGenerally, the IRS will deal directly with you \nor your duly authorized representative.However, we sometimes talk with other \npersons if we need information that you \nhave been unable to provide, or to verify \ninformation we have received.If we do \ncontact other persons, such as a neighbor, \nbank, employer, or employees, we will \ngenerally need to tell them limited \ninformation, such as your name.The law \nprohibits us from disclosing any more \ninformation than is necessary to obtain or \nverify the information we are seeking.Our \nneed to contact other persons may \ncontinue as long as there is activity in your \ncase.If we do contact other persons, you \nhave a right to request a list of those \ncontacted.Your request can be made by \ntelephone, in writing, or during a personal \ninterview.Refunds \nYou may file a claim for refund if you think \nyou paid too much tax.You must generally \nfile the claim within 3 years from the date \nyou filed your original return or 2 years from \nthe date you paid the tax, whichever is \nlater.The law generally provides for interest \non your refund if it is not paid within 45 \ndays of the date you filed your return or \nclaim for refund.Publication 556, \nExamination of Returns, Appeal Rights, \nand Claims for Refund, has more \ninformation on refunds.If you were due a refund but you did not \n\nfile a return, you generally must file your \nreturn within 3 years from the date the \nreturn was due (including extensions) to get \nthat refund.Taxpayer Advocate Service  \nTAS is an independent organization within \nthe IRS that can help protect your taxpayer \nrights.We can

Publication 1  (Rev.9-2017)  Catalog Number 64731W  Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service  www.irs.gov\n\n\fExaminations, Appeals, Collections, and Refunds\n\nExaminations (Audits) \nWe accept most taxpayers’ returns as filed.If we inquire about your return or select it \nfor examination, it does not suggest that \nyou are dishonest.The inquiry or \nexamination may or may not result in more \ntax.We may close your case without \nchange; or, you may receive a refund.The process of selecting a return for \nexamination usually begins in one of two \nways.First, we use computer programs to \nidentify returns that may have incorrect \namounts.These programs may be based \non information returns, such as Forms \n1099 and W-2, on studies of past \nexaminations, or on certain issues \nidentified by compliance projects.Second, \nwe use information from outside sources \nthat indicates that a return may have \nincorrect amounts.These sources may \ninclude newspapers, public records, and \nindividuals.If we determine that the \ninformation is accurate and reliable, we \nmay use it to select a return for \nexamination.Publication 556, Examination of Returns, \n\nAppeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, \nexplains the rules and procedures that we \nfollow in examinations.The following \nsections give an overview of how we \nconduct examinations.By Mail \nWe handle many examinations and \ninquiries by mail.We will send you a letter \nwith either a request for more information \nor a reason why we believe a change to \nyour return may be needed.You can \nrespond by mail or you can request a \npersonal interview with an examiner.If you \nmail us the requested information or \nprovide an explanation, we may or may not \nagree with you, and we will explain the \nreasons for any changes.Please do not \nhesitate to write to us about anything you \ndo not understand.By Interview \nIf we notify you that we will conduct your \nexamination through a personal interview, \nor you request such an interview, you have \nthe right to ask that the examination take \nplace at a reasonable time and place that is \nconvenient for both you and the IRS.If our \nexaminer proposes any changes to your \nreturn, he or she will explain the reasons for \nthe changes.If you do not agree with these \nchanges, you can meet with the examiner’s \nsupervisor.Repeat Examinations \nIf we examined your return for the same \nitems in either of the 2 previous years and \nproposed no change to your tax liability, \nplease contact us as soon as possible so \nwe can see if we should discontinue the \nexamination.Appeals\nIf you do not agree with the examiner’s \nproposed changes, you can appeal them to \n\nthe Appeals Office of the IRS.Most \ndifferences can be settled without \nexpensive and time-consuming court trials.Your appeal rights are explained in detail in \nboth Publication 5, Your Appeal Rights and \nHow To Prepare a Protest If You Don’t \nAgree, and Publication 556, Examination of \nReturns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for \nRefund.If you do not wish to use the Appeals \nOffice or disagree with its findings, you \nmay be able to take your case to the U.S. \nTax Court, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or \nthe U.S. District Court where you live.If \nyou take your case to court, the IRS will \nhave the burden of proving certain facts if \nyou kept adequate records to show your \ntax liability, cooperated with the IRS, and \nmeet certain other conditions.If the court \nagrees with you on most issues in your \ncase and finds that our position was largely \nunjustified, you may be able to recover \nsome of your administrative and litigation \ncosts.You will not be eligible to recover \nthese costs unless you tried to resolve your \ncase administratively, including going \nthrough the appeals system, and you gave \nus the information necessary to resolve the \ncase.Collections \nPublication 594, The IRS Collection \nProcess, explains your rights and \nresponsibilities regarding payment of \nfederal taxes.It describes: \n(cid:127) What to do when you owe taxes.It \n\ndescribes what to do if you get a tax bill \nand what to do if you think your bill is \nwrong.It also covers making installment \npayments, delaying collection action, \nand submitting an offer in compromise.(cid:127) IRS collection actions.It covers liens, \n\nreleasing a lien, levies, releasing a levy, \nseizures and sales, and release of \nproperty.(cid:127) IRS certification to the State Department \nof a seriously delinquent tax debt, which \nwill generally result in denial of a \npassport application and may lead to \nrevocation of a passport.Your collection appeal rights are explained \nin detail in Publication 1660, Collection \nAppeal Rights.Innocent Spouse Relief \nGenerally, both you and your spouse are \neach responsible for paying the full \namount of tax, interest, and penalties due \non your joint return.However, if you \nqualify for innocent spouse relief, you may \nbe relieved of part or all of the joint \nliability.To request relief, you must file \nForm 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse \nRelief.For more information on innocent \nspouse relief, see Publication 971, Innocent \nSpouse Relief, and Form 8857.Potential Third Party Contacts \nGenerally, the IRS will deal directly with you \nor your duly authorized representative.However, we sometimes talk with other \npersons if we need information that you \nhave been unable to provide, or to verify \ninformation we have received.If we do \ncontact other persons, such as a neighbor, \nbank, employer, or employees, we will \ngenerally need to tell them limited \ninformation, such as your name.The law \nprohibits us from disclosing any more \ninformation than is necessary to obtain or \nverify the information we are seeking.Our \nneed to contact other persons may \ncontinue as long as there is activity in your \ncase.If we do contact other persons, you \nhave a right to request a list of those \ncontacted.Your request can be made by \ntelephone, in writing, or during a personal \ninterview.Refunds \nYou may file a claim for refund if you think \nyou paid too much tax.You must generally \nfile the claim within 3 years from the date \nyou filed your original return or 2 years from \nthe date you paid the tax, whichever is \nlater.The law generally provides for interest \non your refund if it is not paid within 45 \ndays of the date you filed your return or \nclaim for refund.Publication 556, \nExamination of Returns, Appeal Rights, \nand Claims for Refund, has more \ninformation on refunds.If you were due a refund but you did not \n\nfile a return, you generally must file your \nreturn within 3 years from the date the \nreturn was due (including extensions) to get \nthat refund.Taxpayer Advocate Service  \nTAS is an independent organization within \nthe IRS that can help protect your taxpayer \nrights.We can offer you help if your tax \nproblem is causing a hardship, or you’ve \ntried but haven’t been able to resolve your \nproblem with the IRS.If you qualify for our \nassistance, which is always free, we

projects.Second, \nwe use information from outside sources \nthat indicates that a return may have \nincorrect amounts.These sources may \ninclude newspapers, public records, and \nindividuals.If we

kept adequate records to show your \ntax liability, cooperated with the IRS, and \nmeet certain other conditions.If the court \nagrees with you on most issues in your \ncase and finds that our position was largely \nunjustified, you may be able to recover \nsome of your administrative and litigation \ncosts.You will not be eligible to recover \nthese costs unless you tried to resolve your \ncase administratively, including going \nthrough the appeals system, and you gave \nus the information necessary to resolve the \ncase.Collections \nPublication 594, The IRS Collection \nProcess,

Rights.Innocent Spouse Relief \nGenerally, both you and your spouse are \neach responsible for paying the full \namount of tax, interest, and penalties due \non your joint return.However, if you \nqualify for innocent spouse relief, you may \nbe relieved of part or all of the joint \nliability.To request relief, you must file \nForm 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse \nRelief.For more information on innocent \nspouse relief, see Publication 971, Innocent \nSpouse Relief, and Form 8857.Potential Third Party Contacts \nGenerally, the IRS will deal directly with you \nor your duly authorized representative.However, we sometimes talk with other \npersons if we need information that you \nhave been unable to provide, or to verify \ninformation we have received.If we do \ncontact other persons, such as a neighbor, \nbank, employer, or employees, we will \ngenerally need to tell them limited \ninformation, such as your name.The law \nprohibits us from disclosing any more \ninformation than is necessary to obtain or \nverify the information we are seeking.Our \nneed to contact other persons may \ncontinue as long as there is activity in your \ncase.If we do contact other persons, you \nhave a right to request a list of those \ncontacted.Your request can be made by \ntelephone, in writing, or during a personal \ninterview.Refunds \nYou may file a claim for refund if you think \nyou paid too much tax.You must generally \nfile the claim within 3 years from the date \nyou filed your original return or 2 years from \nthe date you paid the tax, whichever is \nlater.The law generally provides for interest \non your refund if it is not paid within 45 \ndays of the date you filed your return or \nclaim for refund.Publication 556, \nExamination of Returns, Appeal Rights, \nand Claims for Refund, has more \ninformation on refunds.If you were due a refund but you did not \n\nfile a return, you generally must file your \nreturn within 3 years from the date the \nreturn was due (including extensions) to get \nthat refund.",

Publication 1  (Rev.9-2017)  Catalog Number 64731W  Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service  www.irs.gov\n\n\fExaminations, Appeals, Collections, and Refunds\n\nExaminations (Audits) \nWe accept most taxpayers’ returns as filed.If we inquire about your return or select it \nfor examination, it does not suggest that \nyou are dishonest.The inquiry or \nexamination may or may not result in more \ntax.We may close your case without \nchange; or, you may receive a refund.The process of selecting a return for \nexamination usually begins in one of two \nways.First, we use computer programs to \nidentify returns that may have incorrect \namounts.These programs may be based \non information returns, such as Forms \n1099 and W-2, on studies of past \nexaminations, or on certain issues \nidentified by compliance projects.Second, \nwe use information from outside sources \nthat indicates that a return may have \nincorrect amounts.These sources may \ninclude newspapers, public records, and \nindividuals.If we determine that the \ninformation is accurate and reliable, we \nmay use it to select a return for \nexamination.Publication 556, Examination of Returns, \n\nAppeal Rights, and Claims for Refund, \nexplains the rules and procedures that we \nfollow in examinations.The following \nsections give an overview of how we \nconduct examinations.By Mail \nWe handle many examinations and \ninquiries by mail.We will send you a letter \nwith either a request for more information \nor a reason why we believe a change to \nyour return may be needed.You can \nrespond by mail or you can request a \npersonal interview with an examiner.If you \nmail us the requested information or \nprovide an explanation, we may or may not \nagree with you, and we will explain the \nreasons for any changes.Please do not \nhesitate to write to us about anything you \ndo not understand.By Interview \nIf we notify you that we will conduct your \nexamination through a personal interview, \nor you request such an interview, you have \nthe right to ask that the examination take \nplace at a reasonable time and place that is \nconvenient for both you and the IRS.If our \nexaminer proposes any changes to your \nreturn, he or she will explain the reasons for \nthe changes.If you do not agree with these \nchanges, you can meet with the examiner’s \nsupervisor.Repeat Examinations \nIf we examined your return for the same \nitems in either of the 2 previous years and \nproposed no change to your tax liability, \nplease contact us as soon as possible so \nwe can see if we should discontinue the \nexamination.Appeals\nIf you do not agree with the examiner’s \nproposed changes, you can appeal them to \n\nthe Appeals Office of the IRS.Most \ndifferences can be settled without \nexpensive and time-consuming court trials.Your appeal rights are explained in detail in \nboth Publication 5, Your Appeal Rights and \nHow To Prepare a Protest If You Don’t \nAgree, and Publication 556, Examination of \nReturns, Appeal Rights, and Claims for \nRefund.If you do not wish to use the Appeals \nOffice or disagree with its findings, you \nmay be able to take your case to the U.S. \nTax Court, U.S. Court of Federal Claims, or \nthe U.S. District Court where you live.If \nyou take your case to court, the IRS will \nhave the burden of proving certain facts if \nyou kept adequate records to show your \ntax liability, cooperated with the IRS, and \nmeet certain other conditions.If the court \nagrees with you on most issues in your \ncase and finds that our position was largely \nunjustified, you may be able to recover \nsome of your administrative and litigation \ncosts.You will not be eligible to recover \nthese costs unless you tried to resolve your \ncase administratively, including going \nthrough the appeals system, and you gave \nus the information necessary to resolve the \ncase.Collections \nPublication 594, The IRS Collection \nProcess, explains your rights and \nresponsibilities regarding payment of \nfederal taxes.It describes: \n(cid:127) What to do when you owe taxes.It \n\ndescribes what to do if you get a tax bill \nand what to do if you think your bill is \nwrong.It also covers making installment \npayments, delaying collection action, \nand submitting an offer in compromise.(cid:127) IRS collection actions.It covers liens, \n\nreleasing a lien, levies, releasing a levy, \nseizures and sales, and release of \nproperty.(cid:127) IRS certification to the State Department \nof a seriously delinquent tax debt, which \nwill generally result in denial of a \npassport application and may lead to \nrevocation of a passport.Your collection appeal rights are explained \nin detail in Publication 1660, Collection \nAppeal Rights.Innocent Spouse Relief \nGenerally, both you and your spouse are \neach responsible for paying the full \namount of tax, interest, and penalties due \non your joint return.However, if you \nqualify for innocent spouse relief, you may \nbe relieved of part or all of the joint \nliability.To request relief, you must file \nForm 8857, Request for Innocent Spouse \nRelief.The law generally provides for interest \non your refund if it is not paid within 45 \ndays of the date you filed your return or \nclaim for refund.Publication 556, \nExamination of Returns, Appeal Rights, \nand Claims for Refund, has more \ninformation on refunds.If you were due a refund but you did not \n\nfile a return, you generally must file your \nreturn within 3 years from the date the \nreturn was due (including extensions) to get \nthat refund.Taxpayer Advocate Service  \nTAS is an independent organization within \nthe IRS that can help protect your taxpayer \nrights.If you qualify for our \nassistance, which is always free, we will do \neverything possible to help you.Tax Information \nThe IRS provides the following sources for \nforms, publications, and additional

Const., art. XV, § 1.)Interest accrues on an unpaid judgment amount at the legal rate of 10% per year (7% if the judgment debtor is a state or \nlocal government entity) generally from the date of entry of the judgment.Interest begins to accrue on the amount of costs \nadded to a judgment from the date ordered by the court or from the date costs are allowed following expiration of the time \nto object.(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070(d).)Also, upon renewal of a judgment, interest begins to accrue on the day the \nrenewed judgment is entered.If the judgment is payable in installments, interest accrues from the date each installment is \ndue.Requesting Costs and Interest\nTo have costs and interest added to the enforceable amount owed, the judgment creditor must file and serve a \nMemorandum of Costs After Judgment (form MC-012).On this form, the judgment creditor must include the exact \namount of all costs and accrued interest.It is useful to update this calculation after receiving payments.Crediting Payments Received \nAny payments received by the judgment creditor must be “credited” in a specific order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 695.220.)After specific costs go directly to the levying officer and to the court for fees, the judgment creditor is required to credit \npayments received first toward accrued interest and then toward the judgment principal (including costs approved by the \ncourt after entry of the judgment).Calculation of Interest on Judgment and Amount Due\nFollowing are various formulas and examples to assist with the calculation of interest on a judgment using a 10% interest \nrate:\n\n\nCalculating Daily Interest on a Judgment Using 10% Interest Rate\nFollowing is the formula for figuring out the amount of interest earned per day on a judgment.Formula: Total amount of judgment owed x 10% (or 0.10) = interest earned per year.Divide that number by 365 = daily interest earned.Example: Judgment debtor owes the judgment creditor $5,000 (the “judgment principal”).$5,000 x 0.10 = $500 \n$500/365 = $1.37 daily interest\n\nThe amount of interest earned will be $1.37 per day as long as the unpaid amount remains $5,000.Calculating the Total Amount Due, Including Interest, on the date of payment\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment.This amount will equal the daily interest rate \ncalculated above, multiplied by the number of days since the court entered the final judgment.1. Figure out the total number of days that have passed since the court entered the final judgment up to the day of \npayment.Multiply the total days by the amount of daily interest.The result is the amount of interest owing on the day of \npayment. 2.Form Approved for Optional Use \nJudicial Council of California\nMC-013-INFO [New January 1, 2018] \n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT\n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\nMC-013-INFO\n\n\fMC-013-INFO\n\nExample: Assume a $5,000 judgment was entered on June 1 and paid on September 8; 100 days from the entry of \nthe judgment have passed.The daily interest is $1.37 (see above calculation).$1.37 per day x 100 days = $137 interest owed on the date of payment.The judgment debtor owes $137 in interest on the principal of $5,000 on the date of payment.Step 2: Add the amount of interest that has accrued to the amount of the judgment.$5,000 judgment amount + $137 interest = $5,137.The judgment debtor owes a total of $5,137 on the 100th day after the court entered the judgment.\n\nCrediting Partial Payments and Recalculating the Amount Due\n\nIf the judgment debtor does not pay all that is owed at one time, the partial payments the debtor makes are credited\nto the interest first and then to the judgment amount (the principal) owed.Example: Judgment principal of $5,000. First Payment: After 200 days, the judgment debtor pays $1,000\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment\n\nFollowing the above example: $1.37 per day x 200 days.After 200 days, $274 in interest will have accrued \non the $5,000 judgment (200 days x $1.37 per day).Step 2: Apply payment to interest \n\nThe debtor paid $1,000, which must first be used to credit the $274 of accrued interest.That leaves a balance of $726 to be credited toward the $5,000 principal ($1,000 - $274 = $726).Step 3: Apply remainder to principal\n\nThe remaining credit of $726 is applied to the $5,000 judgment principal ($5,000 - $726 = $4,274).The judgment debtor now owes $4,274 on the judgment principal.Step 4: Calculate the new daily interest rate \n\nDaily interest would then accrue at a rate of $1.17/day.$4,274 x 10% = $427.40 interest earned per year.$427.40/365 = $1.17 interest earned per day. Second Payment: After 100 days, a payment of $500 is made (calculate using steps 1–4)\n\nThe amount of interest that accrues in the next 100 days:\n100 days x $1.17 = $117.The payment of $500 must first be credited towards the interest of $117, leaving a balance of $383 to be \ncredited against the principal ($500 - $117 = $383).3. The credit of $383 is then subtracted from the judgment principal of $4,274, leaving an unpaid balance of\n\n$3,891.The new daily interest would then accrue on the principal going forward at a rate of $1.07/day:\n$3,891 x 10% = $389.10/365. 1. 2. 4.MC-013-INFO [New January 1, 2018]\n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT\n\nPage 2 of 2 \n\n\fATTORNEY OR PARTY WITHOUT ATTORNEY\n\nSTATE BAR NUMBER:\n\nMC-012\n\nFOR COURT USE ONLY\n\nSTATE:\n\nFAX NO.:\n\nZIP CODE:\n\nSUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF\nSTREET ADDRESS:\n\nNAME:\n\nFIRM NAME:\n\nSTREET ADDRESS:\n\nCITY:\n\nTELEPHONE NO.Postjudgment costs\n\na. \n\nI claim the following costs after judgment incurred within the last two years (indicate if there are multiple items in any category):\n\nDates Incurred\n\nAmount\n\n(5)\n\n(6) \n\n(1) \n(2) \n(3)\n(4)\n\n(specify county):\n\nPreparing and issuing abstract of judgment\nRecording and indexing abstract of judgment\nFiling notice of judgment lien on personal property\nIssuing writ of execution, to extent not satisfied by Code Civ.To the best of my knowledge and belief, the costs claimed are \ncorrect, reasonable, and necessary, and have not been satisfied.agent for the judgment creditor\n\nI declare under penalty of perjury under the laws of the State of California that the foregoing is true and correct.A motion to tax costs claimed in this memorandum must be filed \nwithin 10 days after service of the memorandum.(Code Civ.

or\n(cid:129)  50 percent of\nthe amount by which the employee's disposable\nearnings that week exceed the applicable minimum wage.If there is a\nlocal minimum wage in effect in the location where the employee works\nthat exceeds the state minimum wage at the time the earnings are\npayable, the local minimum wage is the applicable minimum wage.(cid:129) For a semimonthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly\n\nminimum wage by 86 2/3.Step 3: If the amount from Step 2 is less than zero, do not withhold any\nmoney from the employee's earnings.Step 4: If the amount from Step 2 is greater than zero, multiply that\namount by one-half.Step 5:\nthe\nIf\nemployee's disposable earnings, withhold this amount.If it is greater than\n25 percent of the employee's disposable earnings, withhold 25 percent of\nthe disposable earnings.from Step 4 is lower than 25 percent of\n\nthe amount\n\nOccasionally, the employee's earnings will also be subject to a Wage\nand Earnings Assignment Order, an order available from family law\ncourts for child, spousal, or family support.The amount required to be\nto be\nwithheld for\nwithheld for this order.that order should be deducted from the amount\n\nWHAT IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS? minimum wage by 40. 1. 2. 3.IMPORTANT WARNINGS\nIT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO FIRE THE EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS FOR THE PAYMENT OF ONLY ONE\nINDEBTEDNESS.No matter how many orders you receive, so long as they all relate to a single indebtedness (no matter how many debts are\nrepresented in that judgment), the employee may not be fired.IT IS ILLEGAL TO AVOID AN EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER BY POSTPONING OR ADVANCING THE PAYMENT OF EARNINGS.The\nemployee's pay period must not be changed to prevent the order from taking effect.IT IS ILLEGAL NOT TO PAY AMOUNTS WITHHELD FOR THE EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER TO THE LEVYING OFFICER.Your duty is\nto pay the money to the levying officer who will pay the money in accordance with the law that applies to this case.IF YOU VIOLATE ANY OF THESE LAWS YOU MAY BE HELD LIABLE TO PAY CIVIL DAMAGES AND YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL\nPROSECUTION!

Complete the attached forms in black ink.www.occourts.org/self-help \n\n\fMC-013-INFO\n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT \n\nWhat can the judgment creditor recover?Under California law, the amount recoverable by a judgment creditor includes: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total amount of the judgment entered by the court (principal), plus costs;\nCosts after judgment under Code of Civil Procedure section 685.070; and \nAccrued interest on the total amount.Costs After Judgment \nA judgment creditor is entitled to reimbursement for the “reasonable and necessary” costs of enforcing a judgment.These \ncosts must be reported to the court within two years of the date incurred.(For information on recovering costs and a detailed list of costs that can be recovered see \nCode of Civil Procedure sections 685.040, 685.050 et seq., 685.070(b), and 685.090; see also “Requesting Costs and \nInterest” below).(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070(d).)Also, upon renewal of a judgment, interest begins to accrue on the day the \nrenewed judgment is entered.If the judgment is payable in installments, interest accrues from the date each installment is \ndue.On this form, the judgment creditor must include the exact \namount of all costs and accrued interest.This means the judgment creditor is responsible for calculating the amount of \ninterest that accrues on the judgment.It is useful to update this calculation after receiving payments.Crediting Payments Received \nAny payments received by the judgment creditor must be “credited” in a specific order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 695.220.)Divide that number by 365 = daily interest earned.Example: Judgment debtor owes the judgment creditor $5,000 (the “judgment principal”).$5,000 x 0.10 = $500 \n$500/365 = $1.37 daily interest\n\nThe amount of interest earned will be $1.37 per day as long as the unpaid amount remains $5,000.Calculating the Total Amount Due, Including Interest, on the date of payment\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment.This amount will equal the daily interest rate \ncalculated above, multiplied by the number of days since the court entered the final judgment.1. Figure out the total number of days that have passed since the court entered the final judgment up to the day of \npayment.Multiply the total days by the amount of daily interest.The result is the amount of interest owing on the day of \npayment. 2.Form Approved for Optional Use \nJudicial Council of California\nMC-013-INFO [New January 1, 2018] \n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT\n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\nMC-013-INFO\n\n\fMC-013-INFO\n\nExample: Assume a $5,000 judgment was entered on June 1 and paid on September 8; 100 days from the entry of \nthe judgment have passed.The daily interest is $1.37 (see above calculation).The judgment debtor owes $137 in interest on the principal of $5,000 on the date of payment.Step 2: Add the amount of interest that has accrued to the amount of the judgment.$5,000 judgment amount + $137 interest = $5,137.\n\nCrediting Partial Payments and Recalculating the Amount Due\n\nIf the judgment debtor does not pay all that is owed at one time, the partial payments the debtor makes are credited\nto the interest first and then to the judgment amount (the principal) owed.Example: Judgment principal of $5,000. First Payment: After 200 days, the judgment debtor pays $1,000\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment\n\nFollowing the above example: $1.37 per day x 200 days.After 200 days, $274 in interest will have accrued \non the $5,000 judgment (200 days x $1.37 per day).Step 2: Apply payment to interest \n\nThe debtor paid $1,000, which must first be used to credit the $274 of accrued interest.That leaves a balance of $726 to be credited toward the $5,000 principal ($1,000 - $274 = $726).Step 3: Apply remainder to principal\n\nThe remaining credit of $726 is applied to the $5,000 judgment principal ($5,000 - $726 = $4,274).The judgment debtor now owes $4,274 on the judgment principal.Step 4: Calculate the new daily interest rate \n\nDaily interest would then accrue at a rate of $1.17/day.$4,274 x 10% = $427.40 interest earned per year.$427.40/365 = $1.17 interest earned per day. Second Payment: After 100 days, a payment of $500 is made (calculate using steps 1–4)\n\nThe amount of interest that accrues in the next 100 days:\n100 days x $1.17 = $117.The payment of $500 must first be credited towards the interest of $117, leaving a balance of $383 to be \ncredited against the principal ($500 - $117 = $383).3. The credit of $383 is then subtracted from the judgment principal of $4,274, leaving an unpaid balance of\n\n$3,891.The new daily interest would then accrue on the principal going forward at a rate of $1.07/day:\n$3,891 x 10% = $389.10/365. 1. 2. 4.MC-013-INFO [New January 1, 2018]\n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT\n\nPage 2 of 2 \n\n\fATTORNEY OR PARTY WITHOUT ATTORNEY\n\nSTATE BAR NUMBER:\n\nMC-012\n\nFOR COURT USE ONLY\n\nSTATE:\n\nFAX NO.Credits to interest and principal\n\n$\nI acknowledge total payments to date in the amount of:   \nThe payments received are applied first to the amount of accrued interest, and then to the judgment principal (including\n$\npostjudgment costs allowed) as follows: credit to accrued interest:                          ; credit to judgment principal                          .$\nPrincipal remaining due: The amount of judgment principal remaining due is   \n.Accrued interest remaining due: I declare interest accruing (at the legal rate) from the date of entry or renewal and on \nbalances from the date of any partial satisfactions (or other credits reducing the principal) remaining due in the amount \n$\nof   \nI am the:\nI have knowledge of the facts concerning the costs claimed above.To the best of my knowledge and belief, the costs claimed are \ncorrect, reasonable, and necessary, and have not been satisfied.Form Adopted for Mandatory Use \n Judicial Council of California \nMC-012 [Rev.1. 2. 3.

      "question": "What does the document emphasize about calculating interest?",
      "answer": "1. Interest accrues on an unpaid judgment amount at the legal rate of 10% per year (7% if the judgment debtor is a state or local government entity) generally from the date of entry of the judgment.\n2. Interest begins to accrue on the amount of costs added to a judgment from the date ordered by the court or from the date costs are allowed following expiration of the time to object.\n3. To have costs and interest added to the enforceable amount owed, the judgment creditor must file and serve a Memorandum of Costs After Judgment (form MC-012).\n4. The judgment creditor is responsible for calculating the amount of interest that accrues on the judgment.\n5. The formula for calculating daily interest on a judgment is: Total amount of judgment owed x 10% (or 0.10) = interest earned per year; then divide that number by 365 to get daily interest earned.\n6. Payments received by the judgment creditor must be credited first toward accrued interest and then toward the judgment principal.\n7. If the judgment debtor does not pay all that is owed at one time, the partial payments are credited to the interest first and then to the judgment amount (the principal) owed.",

Const., art. XV, § 1.)Interest accrues on an unpaid judgment amount at the legal rate of 10% per year (7% if the judgment debtor is a state or \nlocal government entity) generally from the date of entry of the judgment.Interest begins to accrue on the amount of costs \nadded to a judgment from the date ordered by the court or from the date costs are allowed following expiration of the time \nto object.(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070(d).)Also, upon renewal of a judgment, interest begins to accrue on the day the \nrenewed judgment is entered.If the judgment is payable in installments, interest accrues from the date each installment is \ndue.Requesting Costs and Interest\nTo have costs and interest added to the enforceable amount owed, the judgment creditor must file and serve a \nMemorandum of Costs After Judgment (form MC-012).On this form, the judgment creditor must include the exact \namount of all costs and accrued interest.This means the judgment creditor is responsible for calculating the amount of \ninterest that accrues on the judgment.It is useful to update this calculation after receiving payments.Crediting Payments Received \nAny payments received by the judgment creditor must be “credited” in a specific order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 695.220.)After specific costs go directly to the levying officer and to the court for fees, the judgment creditor is required to credit \npayments received first toward accrued interest and then toward the judgment principal (including costs approved by the \ncourt after entry of the judgment).Calculation of Interest on Judgment and Amount Due\nFollowing are various formulas and examples to assist with the calculation of interest on a judgment using a 10% interest \nrate:\n\n\nCalculating Daily Interest on a Judgment Using 10% Interest Rate\nFollowing is the formula for figuring out the amount of interest earned per day on a judgment.Formula: Total amount of judgment owed x 10% (or 0.10) = interest earned per year.Divide that number by 365 = daily interest earned.Example: Judgment debtor owes the judgment creditor $5,000 (the “judgment principal”).$5,000 x 0.10 = $500 \n$500/365 = $1.37 daily interest\n\nThe amount of interest earned will be $1.37 per day as long as the unpaid amount remains $5,000.Calculating the Total Amount Due, Including Interest, on the date of payment\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment.This amount will equal the daily interest rate \ncalculated above, multiplied by the number of days since the court entered the final judgment.1. Figure out the total number of days that have passed since the court entered the final judgment up to the day of \npayment.Multiply the total days by the amount of daily interest.The result is the amount of interest owing on the day of \npayment. 2.Form Approved for Optional Use \nJudicial Council of California\nMC-013-INFO [New January 1, 2018] \n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT\n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\nMC-013-INFO\n\n\fMC-013-INFO\n\nExample: Assume a $5,000 judgment was entered on June 1 and paid on September 8; 100 days from the entry of \nthe judgment have passed.The daily interest is $1.37 (see above calculation).$1.37 per day x 100 days = $137 interest owed on the date of payment.The judgment debtor owes $137 in interest on the principal of $5,000 on the date of payment.Step 2: Add the amount of interest that has accrued to the amount of the judgment.$5,000 judgment amount + $137 interest = $5,137.The judgment debtor owes a total of $5,137 on the 100th day after the court entered the judgment.\n\nCrediting Partial Payments and Recalculating the Amount Due\n\nIf the judgment debtor does not pay all that is owed at one time, the partial payments the debtor makes are credited\nto the interest first and then to the judgment amount (the principal) owed.Example: Judgment principal of $5,000. First Payment: After 200 days, the judgment debtor pays $1,000\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment\n\nFollowing the above example: $1.37 per day x 200 days.After 200 days, $274 in interest will have accrued \non the $5,000 judgment (200 days x $1.37 per day).Step 2: Apply payment to interest \n\nThe debtor paid $1,000, which must first be used to credit the $274 of accrued interest.That leaves a balance of $726 to be credited toward the $5,000 principal ($1,000 - $274 = $726).Step 3: Apply remainder to principal\n\nThe remaining credit of $726 is applied to the $5,000 judgment principal ($5,000 - $726 = $4,274).The judgment debtor now owes $4,274 on the judgment principal.Step 4: Calculate the new daily interest rate \n\nDaily interest would then accrue at a rate of $1.17/day.$4,274 x 10% = $427.40 interest earned per year.$427.40/365 = $1.17 interest earned per day. Second Payment: After 100 days, a payment of $500 is made (calculate using steps 1–4)\n\nThe amount of interest that accrues in the next 100 days:\n100 days x $1.17 = $117.The payment of $500 must first be credited towards the interest of $117, leaving a balance of $383 to be \ncredited against the principal ($500 - $117 = $383).3. The credit of $383 is then subtracted from the judgment principal of $4,274, leaving an unpaid balance of\n\n$3,891.The new daily interest would then accrue on the principal going forward at a rate of $1.07/day:\n$3,891 x 10% = $389.10/365. 1. 2. 4.MC-013-INFO [New January 1, 2018]\n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT\n\nPage 2 of 2 \n\n\fATTORNEY OR PARTY WITHOUT ATTORNEY\n\nSTATE BAR NUMBER:\n\nMC-012\n\nFOR COURT USE ONLY\n\nSTATE:\n\nFAX NO.:\n\nZIP CODE:\n\nSUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF\nSTREET ADDRESS:\n\nNAME:\n\nFIRM NAME:\n\nSTREET ADDRESS:\n\nCITY:\n\nTELEPHONE NO.:\n\nE-MAIL ADDRESS:\n\nATTORNEY FOR (name):\n\nMAILING ADDRESS:\n\nCITY AND ZIP CODE:\n\nBRANCH NAME:\n\nPLAINTIFF:\n\nDEFENDANT:\n\nMEMORANDUM OF COSTS AFTER JUDGMENT, ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF \nCREDIT, AND DECLARATION OF ACCRUED INTEREST\n\nCASE NUMBER:\n\n1.Postjudgment costs\n\na. \n\nI claim the following costs after judgment incurred within the last two years (indicate if there are multiple items in any category):\n\nDates Incurred\n\nAmount\n\n(5)\n\n(6) \n\n(1) \n(2) \n(3)\n(4)\n\n(specify county):\n\nPreparing and issuing abstract of judgment\nRecording and indexing abstract of judgment\nFiling notice of judgment lien on personal property\nIssuing writ of execution, to extent not satisfied by Code Civ.Proc.,  \n§ 685.050 \nLevying officers fees, to extent not satisfied by Code Civ.Proc.,  \n§ 685.050 or wage garnishment\nApproved fee on application for order for appearance of judgment \ndebtor, or other approved costs under Code Civ.Proc., § 708.110 \net seq.

covered by the Earnings With-\nholding Order (this order).The withholding period begins 10 calendar days\nafter you receive the order and continues until the total amount due, plus\nadditional amounts for costs and interest (which will be listed in a levying\nofficer's notice), is withheld.It may end sooner if (1) you receive a written notice signed by the\nlevying officer specifying an earlier termination date, or (2) an order of\nhigher priority (explained on the reverse of the Employer's Return (form\nWG-005) is received.You are entitled to rely on and must obey all written notices signed by the\nlevying officer.The Employer's Return (form WG-005) describes several situations that\ncould affect the withholding period for this order.If you receive more than\none Earnings Withholding Order during a withholding period, review that\nform (Employer's Return) for instructions.If the employee stops working for you, the Earnings Withholding Order\nends after no amounts are withheld for a continuous 180-day period.If\nwithholding ends because the earnings are subject to an order of higher\npriority, the Earnings Withholding Order ends after a continuous two-year\nperiod during which no amounts are withheld under the order.Return the\nEarnings Withholding Order to the levying officer with a statement of\nthe reason it is being returned.WHAT TO DO WITH THE MONEY\nThe amounts withheld during the withholding period must be paid to the\nlevying officer by the 15th of the next month after each payday.If you wish\nto pay more frequently than monthly, each payment must be made within\n10 days after the close of the pay period.Be sure to mark each check with the case number, the levying officer's file\nnumber,\nif different, and the employee's name so the money will be\napplied to the correct account.The garnishment\nlaw is contained in the Code of Civil Procedure\nbeginning with section 706.010.Sections 706.022, 706.025, 706.050, and\n706.104 explain the employer's duties.The Federal Wage Garnishment Law and federal rules provide the basic\nthe\nprotections on which the California law is based.federal law will be answered by mail, telephone, or personal interview at\nany office of the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor.Offices are listed in the telephone directory under the U.S. Department of\nLabor in the U.S. Government listing.Inquiries about\n\nCOMPUTATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nCalifornia law provides how much earnings to withhold, if any, for different\namounts of disposable earnings and different pay periods, and takes into\nconsideration different minimum wage amounts.The method of calculation\nis at Code of Civil Procedure section 706.050 and is described in the\ncolumn to the right.You may also look on the California Courts Self-Help\nwebsite for assistance in determining the maximum withholding amounts\nfor different amounts of disposable income, for different pay periods, and\nwith different minimum wage amounts.The information is at\nwww.courts.ca.gov/self-help-employerwagecivil.htm.THESE COMPUTATION INSTRUCTIONS APPLY UNDER NORMAL \nCIRCUMSTANCES.THEY  DO NOT APPLY TO ORDERS FOR THE \nSUPPORT OF A SPOUSE, FORMER SPOUSE, OR CHILD.State law limits the amount of earnings that can be withheld.The\nlimitations are based on the employee's disposable earnings, which are\ndifferent from gross pay or take-home pay.(A) To determine the CORRECT AMOUNT OF EARNINGS TO BE WITH-\nHELD (if any), first compute the employee's disposable earnings.Earnings\nsalary,\ncalled wages,\ncommissions, bonuses, or anything else) that is paid by an employer to an\nemployee for personal services.Vacation or sick pay is subject\nto\nis received by the employee.Tips are generally not\nwithholding as it\nincluded as earnings because they are not paid by the employer.any money\n\n(whether\n\ninclude\n\nDisposable earnings are the earnings left after subtracting the part of the\nearnings a state or federal law requires an employer to withhold.Generally\nthese required deductions are (1) federal\nincome tax, (2) federal social\nsecurity, (3) state income tax, (4) state disability insurance, and \n(5) payments to public employee retirement systems.Disposable earnings\nwill change when the required deductions change.(B) After the employee's disposable earnings are known, to determine\nwhat amount should be withheld, you may look to the statute, follow the\ndirections below in (C), or seek assistance on the California Courts Self-\nHelp website at www.courts.ca.gov/self-help-employerwagecivil.htm.Note that you also need to know the amount of the minimum wage in the\nlocation where the employee works.(C) Calculate the maximum amount\nthat may be withheld from the\nemployee's disposable earnings, which is the lesser of the following two\namounts:\n\n(cid:129) 25 percent of disposable earnings for that week; or\n(cid:129)  50 percent of\nthe amount by which the employee's disposable\nearnings that week exceed the applicable minimum wage.If there is a\nlocal minimum wage in effect in the location where the employee works\nthat exceeds the state minimum wage at the time the earnings are\npayable, the local minimum wage is the applicable minimum wage.To calculate the correct amount, follow the steps below: \nStep 1: Determine the applicable minimum wage per pay period.(cid:129) For a daily or weekly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly\n\n(cid:129) For a biweekly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum\n\nwage by 80.(cid:129) For a semimonthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly\n\nminimum wage by 86 2/3.(cid:129) For a monthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum\n\nwage by 173 1/3.Step 2: Subtract the amount from Step 1 from the employee's disposable\nearnings during that pay period.Step 3: If the amount from Step 2 is less than zero, do not withhold any\nmoney from the employee's earnings.Step 4: If the amount from Step 2 is greater than zero, multiply that\namount by one-half.Step 5:\nthe\nIf\nemployee's disposable earnings, withhold this amount.If it is greater than\n25 percent of the employee's disposable earnings, withhold 25 percent of\nthe disposable earnings.from Step 4 is lower than 25 percent of\n\nthe amount\n\nOccasionally, the employee's earnings will also be subject to a Wage\nand Earnings Assignment Order, an order available from family law\ncourts for child, spousal, or family support.The amount required to be\nto be\nwithheld for\nwithheld

EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS FOR THE PAYMENT OF ONLY ONE\nINDEBTEDNESS.No matter how many orders you receive, so long as they all relate to a single indebtedness (no matter how many debts are\nrepresented in that judgment), the employee may not be fired.IT IS ILLEGAL TO AVOID AN EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER BY POSTPONING OR ADVANCING THE PAYMENT OF EARNINGS.The\nemployee's pay period must not be changed to prevent the order from taking effect.IT IS ILLEGAL NOT TO PAY AMOUNTS WITHHELD FOR THE EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER TO THE LEVYING OFFICER.Your duty is\nto pay the money to the levying officer who will pay the money in accordance with the law that applies to this case.IF YOU VIOLATE ANY OF THESE LAWS YOU MAY BE HELD LIABLE TO PAY CIVIL DAMAGES AND YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO

Const., art. XV, § 1.)Interest accrues on an unpaid judgment amount at the legal rate of 10% per year (7% if the judgment debtor is a state or \nlocal government entity) generally from the date of entry of the judgment.Interest begins to accrue on the amount of costs \nadded to a judgment from the date ordered by the court or from the date costs are allowed following expiration of the time \nto object.(Code Civ. Proc., § 685.070(d).)Also, upon renewal of a judgment, interest begins to accrue on the day the \nrenewed judgment is entered.If the judgment is payable in installments, interest accrues from the date each installment is \ndue.Requesting Costs and Interest\nTo have costs and interest added to the enforceable amount owed, the judgment creditor must file and serve a \nMemorandum of Costs After Judgment (form MC-012).On this form, the judgment creditor must include the exact \namount of all costs and accrued interest.This means the judgment creditor is responsible for calculating the amount of \ninterest that accrues on the judgment.It is useful to update this calculation after receiving payments.Crediting Payments Received \nAny payments received by the judgment creditor must be “credited” in a specific order. (Code Civ. Proc., § 695.220.)After specific costs go directly to the levying officer and to the court for fees, the judgment creditor is required to credit \npayments received first toward accrued interest and then toward the judgment principal (including costs approved by the \ncourt after entry of the judgment).Calculation of Interest on Judgment and Amount Due\nFollowing are various formulas and examples to assist with the calculation of interest on a judgment using a 10% interest \nrate:\n\n\nCalculating Daily Interest on a Judgment Using 10% Interest Rate\nFollowing is the formula for figuring out the amount of interest earned per day on a judgment.Formula: Total amount of judgment owed x 10% (or 0.10) = interest earned per year.Divide that number by 365 = daily interest earned.Example: Judgment debtor owes the judgment creditor $5,000 (the “judgment principal”).$5,000 x 0.10 = $500 \n$500/365 = $1.37 daily interest\n\nThe amount of interest earned will be $1.37 per day as long as the unpaid amount remains $5,000.Calculating the Total Amount Due, Including Interest, on the date of payment\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment.This amount will equal the daily interest rate \ncalculated above, multiplied by the number of days since the court entered the final judgment.1. Figure out the total number of days that have passed since the court entered the final judgment up to the day of \npayment.Multiply the total days by the amount of daily interest.The result is the amount of interest owing on the day of \npayment. 2.Form Approved for Optional Use \nJudicial Council of California\nMC-013-INFO [New January 1, 2018] \n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT\n\nPage 1 of 2 \n\nMC-013-INFO\n\n\fMC-013-INFO\n\nExample: Assume a $5,000 judgment was entered on June 1 and paid on September 8; 100 days from the entry of \nthe judgment have passed.The daily interest is $1.37 (see above calculation).$1.37 per day x 100 days = $137 interest owed on the date of payment.The judgment debtor owes $137 in interest on the principal of $5,000 on the date of payment.Step 2: Add the amount of interest that has accrued to the amount of the judgment.$5,000 judgment amount + $137 interest = $5,137.The judgment debtor owes a total of $5,137 on the 100th day after the court entered the judgment.\n\nCrediting Partial Payments and Recalculating the Amount Due\n\nIf the judgment debtor does not pay all that is owed at one time, the partial payments the debtor makes are credited\nto the interest first and then to the judgment amount (the principal) owed.Example: Judgment principal of $5,000. First Payment: After 200 days, the judgment debtor pays $1,000\n\nStep 1: Calculate the amount of interest owed on the date of payment\n\nFollowing the above example: $1.37 per day x 200 days.After 200 days, $274 in interest will have accrued \non the $5,000 judgment (200 days x $1.37 per day).Step 2: Apply payment to interest \n\nThe debtor paid $1,000, which must first be used to credit the $274 of accrued interest.That leaves a balance of $726 to be credited toward the $5,000 principal ($1,000 - $274 = $726).Step 3: Apply remainder to principal\n\nThe remaining credit of $726 is applied to the $5,000 judgment principal ($5,000 - $726 = $4,274).The judgment debtor now owes $4,274 on the judgment principal.Step 4: Calculate the new daily interest rate \n\nDaily interest would then accrue at a rate of $1.17/day.$4,274 x 10% = $427.40 interest earned per year.$427.40/365 = $1.17 interest earned per day. Second Payment: After 100 days, a payment of $500 is made (calculate using steps 1–4)\n\nThe amount of interest that accrues in the next 100 days:\n100 days x $1.17 = $117.The payment of $500 must first be credited towards the interest of $117, leaving a balance of $383 to be \ncredited against the principal ($500 - $117 = $383).3. The credit of $383 is then subtracted from the judgment principal of $4,274, leaving an unpaid balance of\n\n$3,891.The new daily interest would then accrue on the principal going forward at a rate of $1.07/day:\n$3,891 x 10% = $389.10/365. 1. 2. 4.MC-013-INFO [New January 1, 2018]\n\nINFORMATION SHEET FOR CALCULATING INTEREST\nAND AMOUNT OWED ON A JUDGMENT\n\nPage 2 of 2 \n\n\fATTORNEY OR PARTY WITHOUT ATTORNEY\n\nSTATE BAR NUMBER:\n\nMC-012\n\nFOR COURT USE ONLY\n\nSTATE:\n\nFAX NO.:\n\nZIP CODE:\n\nSUPERIOR COURT OF CALIFORNIA, COUNTY OF\nSTREET ADDRESS:\n\nNAME:\n\nFIRM NAME:\n\nSTREET ADDRESS:\n\nCITY:\n\nTELEPHONE NO.:\n\nE-MAIL ADDRESS:\n\nATTORNEY FOR (name):\n\nMAILING ADDRESS:\n\nCITY AND ZIP CODE:\n\nBRANCH NAME:\n\nPLAINTIFF:\n\nDEFENDANT:\n\nMEMORANDUM OF COSTS AFTER JUDGMENT, ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF \nCREDIT, AND DECLARATION OF ACCRUED INTEREST\n\nCASE NUMBER:\n\n1.Postjudgment costs\n\na. \n\nI claim the following costs after judgment incurred within the last two years (indicate if there are multiple items in any category):\n\nDates Incurred\n\nAmount\n\n(5)\n\n(6) \n\n(1) \n(2) \n(3)\n(4)\n\n(specify county):\n\nPreparing and issuing abstract of judgment\nRecording and indexing abstract of judgment\nFiling notice of judgment lien on personal property\nIssuing writ of execution, to extent not satisfied by Code Civ.Proc.,  \n§ 685.050 \nLevying officers fees, to extent not satisfied by Code Civ.Proc.,  \n§ 685.050 or wage garnishment\nApproved fee on application for order for appearance of judgment \ndebtor, or other approved costs under Code Civ.Proc., § 708.110 \net seq.

for costs and interest (which will be listed in a levying\nofficer's notice), is withheld.It may end sooner if (1) you receive a written notice signed by the\nlevying officer specifying an earlier

Order during a withholding period, review that\nform (Employer's Return) for instructions.If the employee stops working for you, the Earnings Withholding Order\nends after no amounts are withheld for a continuous 180-day period.If\nwithholding ends because the earnings are subject to an order of higher\npriority, the Earnings Withholding Order ends after a continuous two-year\nperiod during which

employer's duties.The Federal Wage Garnishment Law and federal rules provide the basic\nthe\nprotections on which the California law is based.federal law will be answered by mail, telephone, or personal interview at\nany office of the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S. Department of Labor.Offices are listed in the telephone directory under the U.S. Department of\nLabor in the U.S. Government listing.Inquiries about\n\nCOMPUTATION INSTRUCTIONS\n\nCalifornia law provides how much earnings to withhold, if any, for different\namounts of disposable earnings and different pay periods, and takes into\nconsideration different minimum wage amounts.The method of calculation\nis at Code of Civil Procedure section 706.050 and is described in the\ncolumn to the right.You may also look on the California Courts Self-Help\nwebsite for assistance in determining the maximum withholding amounts\nfor different amounts of disposable income, for different pay periods, and\nwith different minimum wage amounts.The information is at\nwww.courts.ca.gov/self-help-employerwagecivil.htm.THESE COMPUTATION INSTRUCTIONS APPLY UNDER NORMAL \nCIRCUMSTANCES.THEY  DO NOT APPLY TO ORDERS FOR THE \nSUPPORT OF A SPOUSE, FORMER SPOUSE, OR CHILD.State law limits the amount of earnings that can be withheld.The\nlimitations are based on the employee's disposable earnings, which are\ndifferent from gross pay or take-home pay.(A) To determine the CORRECT AMOUNT OF EARNINGS TO BE WITH-\nHELD (if any), first compute the employee's disposable earnings.Earnings\nsalary,\ncalled wages,\ncommissions, bonuses, or anything else) that is paid by an employer to an\nemployee for personal services.Vacation or sick pay is subject\nto\nis received by the employee.Tips are generally not\nwithholding as it\nincluded as earnings because they are not paid by the employer.any money\n\n(whether\n\ninclude\n\nDisposable earnings are the earnings left after subtracting the part of the\nearnings a state or federal law requires an employer to withhold.Generally\nthese required deductions are (1) federal\nincome tax, (2) federal social\nsecurity, (3) state income tax, (4) state disability insurance, and \n(5) payments to public employee retirement systems.Disposable earnings\nwill change when the required deductions change.(B) After the employee's disposable earnings are known, to determine\nwhat amount should be withheld, you may look to the statute, follow the\ndirections below in (C), or seek assistance on the California Courts Self-\nHelp website at www.courts.ca.gov/self-help-employerwagecivil.htm.Note that you also need to know the amount of the minimum wage in the\nlocation where the employee works.(C) Calculate the maximum amount\nthat may be withheld from the\nemployee's disposable earnings, which is the lesser of the following two\namounts:\n\n(cid:129) 25 percent of disposable earnings for that week; or\n(cid:129)  50 percent of\nthe amount by which the employee's disposable\nearnings that week exceed the applicable minimum wage.If there is a\nlocal minimum wage in effect in the location where the employee works\nthat exceeds the state minimum wage at the time the earnings are\npayable, the local minimum wage is the applicable minimum wage.To calculate the correct amount, follow the steps below: \nStep 1: Determine the applicable minimum wage per pay period.(cid:129) For a daily or weekly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly\n\n(cid:129) For a biweekly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum\n\nwage by 80.(cid:129) For a semimonthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly\n\nminimum wage by 86 2/3.(cid:129) For a monthly pay period, multiply the applicable hourly minimum\n\nwage by 173 1/3.Step 2: Subtract the amount from Step 1 from the employee's disposable\nearnings during that pay period.Step 3: If the amount from Step 2 is less than zero, do not withhold any\nmoney from the employee's earnings.Step 4: If the amount from Step 2 is greater than zero, multiply that\namount by one-half.Step 5:\nthe\nIf\nemployee's disposable earnings, withhold this amount.If it is greater than\n25 percent of the employee's disposable earnings, withhold 25 percent of\nthe disposable earnings.from Step 4 is lower than 25 percent of\n\nthe amount\n\nOccasionally, the employee's earnings will also be subject to a Wage\nand Earnings Assignment Order, an order available from family law\ncourts for child, spousal, or family support.The amount required to be\nto be\nwithheld for\nwithheld for this order.that order should be deducted from the amount\n\nWHAT IF YOU STILL HAVE QUESTIONS? minimum wage by 40. 1. 2. 3.IMPORTANT WARNINGS\nIT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO FIRE THE EMPLOYEE BECAUSE OF EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDERS FOR THE PAYMENT OF ONLY ONE\nINDEBTEDNESS.No matter how many orders you receive, so long as they all relate to a single indebtedness (no matter how many debts are\nrepresented in that judgment), the employee may not be fired.IT IS ILLEGAL TO AVOID AN EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER BY POSTPONING OR ADVANCING THE PAYMENT OF EARNINGS.The\nemployee's pay period must not be changed to prevent the order from taking effect.IT IS ILLEGAL NOT TO PAY AMOUNTS WITHHELD FOR THE EARNINGS WITHHOLDING ORDER TO THE LEVYING OFFICER.Your duty is\nto pay the money to the levying officer who will pay the money in accordance with the law that applies to this case.IF YOU VIOLATE ANY OF THESE LAWS YOU MAY BE HELD LIABLE TO PAY CIVIL DAMAGES AND YOU MAY BE SUBJECT TO

He - he - he - he had been knocked kinda silly, uh, it looked like his \nhead, uh, definitely hit the concrete after the leg strike because when he did get \nhit in the head or kicked in the head his head was elevated off the concrete and it \nwas then, uh, shoved, um, pushed, and it struck the c- the - the concrete \npavement right underneath him, um, and it looked like it hit around the temple \narea and I know that the kick appeared to hit somewhere near the back of \nMendoza  head, uh, which, um, is, uh, extremely susceptible to causing, uh, \nconcussions. Uh, and I know that just from, uh, my  own personal knowledge. Uh, \nany time, you know, playin  football or whatnot, and if you get, um, hit in the back \nof the head you  gonna - you  - you  - you  - you  gonna be seein  \nTweety Birds. So, uh, I could imagine the force that Schmidt used on Mendoza \nas he was laying down on the concrete face down, uh, and then getting the - the \n- the - I mean, essentially it caused two - two, uh, two, uh, you know, two injuries. \nUh, one was the kick to the back of the head, which would be obviously - uh, \ncause some probably, uh, highly likely of, uh, you know, knock him kinda \nsenseless and then his head hitting the concrete, uh, also in the temple area, uh, \nis also gonna cause some - some issues, uh, with his, uh, his brain function, uh, \nat least temporarily, which it appeared to do so. Anything else, uh, any other \nquestions to follow up on so far? Uh, I can think...",

Communication is always key. Uh, we talked about earlier about \nall the incident debriefs that I attend, uh - uh, for, uh, uses of force and - and \nSWAT tactics and incidents, uh, that involve, uh, you know, deadly force, um, or \nless lethal force. The breakdown is always communication, always, always, \nalways. Somewhere along the line, had better communication been used so \npeople are informed about what actual factual information is occurring they can \nprocess that much, uh - they can process that and come up with a better decision \nand use better judgment. The fact that Schmidt decided not to tell them, I think, \nplayed a huge role in this issue, um, escalating much faster and Schmidt  \ndecision-making to take care of it on his own. Uh, had he told Coleman and \nTrudeau that it looked like he was reachin  for something then I believe, hopefully \nwhat would have happened is they would have slowed down, they would have, \nuh, used much better contact and cover tactics. Um, they - they could have even \n- I - I know that, you know, Maka was close to Trudeau but he was - appeared to \nbe, you know, very compliant, uh, they had plenty of time for what they had to \nwait for additional units which were on the way. Uh, there was no reason to, uh - \nuh, rush to cuffing both individuals, as they were proned out, uh, on the \npavement face down. Um, so for all intents and purposes they were - they were \nbeing - they were submitting to arrest and/or detention.

Schmidt never did that, yet \nit was so important for him to use this force because he so adamantly believed \nthat Mendoza was going to shoot Officer Coleman in the back or anybody else, \nthe first thing he does after he handcuffs him is he stands up, Schmidt, or he - he \n- he was already standing up but he, you know, he stands erect, he looks around, \nand then he runs into Burlington Coat Factory to make sure nothin  else is goin  \non. Um, I found that completely, uh - uh, out of place and not consistent with \nother officers  behavior that I  seen on the dozens of use of force videos, my \nown experience, my own training. Uh, I know the - the - the first thing we teach \nofficers once they do detain somebody in handcuffs is, do a quick Terry search, a \npat search. If you  not gonna do a - a - a complete, full search of someone \nbecause there are some rapidly evolving events occurring but you need to make \nsure you - you at least do that pat search. Officers - or I  sorry, uh, just because \nwe put someone in handcuffs doesn  mean they - they can  acquire weapons. \nUh, there  been just numerous instances across the nation where people who \nare handcuffs have slipped cuffs, uh, they  uh, very nimble and they  very, \num - um, uh, um, uh, bendable flexible where they  able to maneuver their \nhands across into their waistband, uh, to the front, they can put the - put their \ncuffs i- in - uh, move their cuffs from underneath their - their back to their front. \nSo searching someone immediately after detention in handcuffs, uh, is key, and I \nthought it was interesting, uh, and out of character, uh, and inconsistent is \nprobably the best word that I could say, uh, with everything that I  seen where \nif Schmidt was so de- uh, f- um, concerned about Mendoza having a weapon, in \nthis case a handgun, why didn  he immediately do a quick waistband search of \nMendoza?  \nbasketball shorts on, it was clear, it was a hot - it was June so it was - it was a \nhot day out. Um, I think a really quick - he probably could have, um, swept that \nwaistband area and determined if there was a weapon in less than five seconds if \nhe actually had a handgun, that he woulda - he would have found it immediately \nif he actually was armed. But he didn  and he ran inside the store, uh, you know, \nthe- and the other thing with that too is that while all this was goin  on there was \nno evidence that I found that the people from inside the store were saying,  \nthere  someone else inside, we  be- the fight is still occurring, we need help \ninside,  that never happened. Uh, there was no - Dispatch never notified, uh, \nI know the officers, you know, when you  focused and you  tryin  to",

Um, I think \nit  absolutely reasonable that you can accept - you could expect someone to be \nknocked unconscious temporarily, even for a few seconds, which it looks like, \nfrom what I could tell in - in the video that that may have actually occurred to \nMendoza after the - the leg strike from, uh, Schmidt. Um, so tryin  to, um, to \nexpect that someone after a leg strike to the head is going to - you  going to \ngain compliance, further compliance after that type of use of force, uh, is - i- is \ncompletely - it  - it  irrational and it - and it  illogical and it  - and it  - it  \ncompletely misplaced. Um, because of the leg strike to the head, Mendoza \nappeared to me to be - he was kinda mumbling, i- what it sounded like in the \nvideo, he wasn  makin  a lotta sense for that, mmm, \nseconds, um, as Schmidt is then kicking out his arms. Um, it was evident that \nMendoza was not, um - he was not - his - his frontal lobe wasn  functioning, \nessentially. He - he - he - he had been knocked kinda silly, uh, it looked like his \nhead, uh, definitely hit the concrete after the leg strike because when he did get \nhit in the head or kicked in the head his head was elevated off the concrete and it \nwas then, uh, shoved, um, pushed, and it struck the c- the - the concrete \npavement right underneath him, um, and it looked like it hit around the temple \narea and I know that the kick appeared to hit somewhere near the back of \nMendoza  head, uh, which, um, is, uh, extremely susceptible to causing, uh, \nconcussions. Uh, and I know that just from, uh, my  own personal knowledge. Uh, \nany time, you know, playin  football or whatnot, and if you get, um, hit in the back \nof the head you  gonna - you  - you  - you  - you  gonna be seein  \nTweety Birds. So, uh, I could imagine the force that Schmidt used on Mendoza \nas he was laying down on the concrete face down, uh, and then getting the - the \n- the - I mean, essentially it caused two - two, uh, two, uh, you know, two injuries. \nUh, one was the kick to the back of the head, which would be obviously - uh, \ncause some probably, uh, highly likely of, uh, you know, knock him kinda \nsenseless and then his head hitting the concrete, uh, also in the temple area, uh, \nis also gonna cause some - some issues, uh, with his, uh, his brain function, uh, \nat least temporarily, which it appeared to do so.

Schmidt could have, uh - and at this - i- i- in my \nopinion, he should have just held on, um, Mendoza, uh, he had lethal coverage \non him which was, uh, totally reasonable, uh, I don  have an issue with, uh, their \nguns bein  out given the circumstances, uh, there are some unknowns so, um, \nMendoza was - was down, um, he was, uh, for all intents and purposes he was \nbeing, uh, co- uh, cooperative.

There  one mention of gang signs, um, by the RP  or \nwitnesses inside Burlington. Schmidt associates gang members with being \narmed. That  not an unreasonable assumption but the problem is is that yo- in - \nin all circumstances we can  just assume and think a- and believe just because \nsomeone is a potential gangster, uh, that they are all armed, and - and therefore \nit justifies a, uh, a - a use of force against them without any other articulable facts \nand circumstances to justify that. So the - the problem with what Schmidt did in \nthis case, in my  opinion, is that he - he inserted, um, a fact that was not true, \nmeaning he believed that just because they threw some gang size - gang signs, \none, that these were gangsters, two, that they were armed, um, and therefore he \nbelieved that they had an intent to shoot Officer Coleman or himself or Officer \nTrudeau or whoever else in that parking lot. All other indications would conflict \nwith that assumption and that belief by Officer Schmidt. Uh, again, we get back to \nwhat were the facts that he - what were the circumstances that he faced outside \nof that - his own personal belief, um, that they were armed? Again, you have \nMendoza who came out, he was, uh, he was being, uh, cooperative, he laid \ndown in a - in a position of, um, disadvantage and a s- you know, more or less a \nsubmission to our authority. Uh, again, yes, he wasn  complying with putting his \narms out to his side, um, but that still doesn  in and of itself justify the force that \nhe used to, um, force the hands out from his side so he can ensure that he didn  \nhave a weapon. There were other tactics he should have used and could have \nused other than a kick to the head, which as I talked about, is completely, um, \nillogical and il- unreasonable to think that a kick to the head is actually - you  \ngoing to actually gain further compliance, uh, from that subject knowing that a \nstrike to the head of any magnitude, really, is going to, you know, cause some \ntype of GBI, which under the - under, you know, the definition of GBI, it  a state \nof unconsciousness, would - would, uh, would fit that.

Schmidt never did that, yet \nit was so important for him to use this force because he so adamantly believed \nthat Mendoza was going to shoot Officer Coleman in the back or anybody else, \nthe first thing he does after he handcuffs him is he stands up, Schmidt, or he - he \n- he was already standing up but he, you know, he stands erect, he looks around, \nand then he runs into Burlington Coat Factory to make sure nothin  else is goin  \non. Um, I found that completely, uh - uh, out of place and not consistent with \nother officers  behavior that I  seen on the dozens of use of force videos, my \nown experience, my own training. Uh, I know the - the - the first thing we teach \nofficers once they do detain somebody in handcuffs is, do a quick Terry search, a \npat search. If you  not gonna do a - a - a complete, full search of someone \nbecause there are some rapidly evolving events occurring but you need to make \nsure you - you at least do that pat search. Officers - or I  sorry, uh, just because \nwe put someone in handcuffs doesn  mean they - they can  acquire weapons. \nUh, there  been just numerous instances across the nation where people who \nare handcuffs have slipped cuffs, uh, they  uh, very nimble and they  very, \num - um, uh, um, uh, bendable flexible where they  able to maneuver their \nhands across into their waistband, uh, to the front, they can put the - put their \ncuffs i- in - uh, move their cuffs from underneath their - their back to their front. \nSo searching someone immediately after detention in handcuffs, uh, is key, and I \nthought it was interesting, uh, and out of character, uh, and inconsistent is \nprobably the best word that I could say, uh, with everything that I  seen where \nif Schmidt was so de- uh, f- um, concerned about Mendoza having a weapon, in \nthis case a handgun, why didn  he immediately do a quick waistband search of \nMendoza?  \nbasketball shorts on, it was clear, it was a hot - it was June so it was - it was a \nhot day out. Um, I think a really quick - he probably could have, um, swept that \nwaistband area and determined if there was a weapon in less than five seconds if \nhe actually had a handgun, that he woulda - he would have found it immediately \nif he actually was armed. But he didn  and he ran inside the store, uh, you know, \nthe- and the other thing with that too is that while all this was goin  on there was \nno evidence that I found that the people from inside the store were saying,  \nthere  someone else inside, we  be- the fight is still occurring, we need help \ninside,  that never happened. Uh, there was no - Dispatch never notified, uh, \nI know the officers, you know, when you  focused and you  tryin  to",

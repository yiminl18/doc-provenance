If  yes,  how  should  it  be \nintegrated  in  the  daily  cost  of  driving  a  car  to  work?  Then  we \nshould  also  add  the  cost  associated  to  the  fuel  used  for  that \nspecific trip. For the computation of CO2 emissions, in a similar \nway, many questions are open. How should we calculate the CO2 \nemissions  of  someone  taking  the  bus?    Should  we  take  into \naccount  the  number  of  passengers  in  the  bus  on  that  specific \nday?  Or  should  we  make  an  estimation  as  an  average?  We \ntargeted  specifically  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  due  to \ncommuting  as  these  quantities  are  at  the  same  time  hard  to \ncompute  accurately  for  people  and  can  have  a  relative  strong",

A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission \nfigures on some kind of directional scale – i.e. is it a little or a lot, \ngood  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?    For  instance,  after  the \nresearcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she \nasked  and  commented:  “Is  it  quite  good?  I  can’t  appreciate  it.” \n(P6).  This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking \nactions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.  It \ndemonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2 \nemissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting) \npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the \ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.",

The calculator was showing \nthat  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with \nthe  bus.  When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was \nsurprised  and  said:  “Ah… I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in \nbus”.  The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2 \nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits \n103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).  In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  “which \nwould  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less  CO2  than  a  bus \neven when it is full?”. This result was really surprising for P5 and \nP9  because  it  did  not  comply  with  the  reality  of  facts  as  they \nperceived  them.  When  P9  chose  to  go  by  bus,  his  car  was  not \nused  over  the  trip  whereas  when  he  chose  the  option  of  car-\nsharing,  the  bus  was  circulating  anyway.  So,  from  his \nperspective,  the  travel  by  bus  cannot  correspond  to  a  higher \nemission of CO2 than the travel by car-sharing, because there is \none less car on the road.",

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

The login\nsystems set up by IT departments for these purposes\ntypically use state of the art encryption algorithms, 2-\nfactor authentication, and the like. In contrast, an\nExcel spreadsheet can be “locked” such that only\nsome ﬁelds are editable. But it is not possible to\nrestrict data access by user. Furthermore, this re-\nstriction is to “write” access only, not to “read” ac-\ncess. It is true that one can “hide” columns in a\nspreadsheet and then lock it, to prevent a given user\nfrom viewing them, but the spreadsheet maintainer\nmust do this manually before distributing the\nspreadsheet (time-consuming and prone to error).",

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

Large spreadsheets (containing\nthousands of rows and hundreds of columns) are\nextremely slow and memory intensive. However, one\ncan query across or manipulate many gigabytes of data\nin fractions of a second in many RDBS, as the data\nstores are highly optimized and efﬁcient from both a\ncomputational and memory utilization perspective.\n7. RDBS are much more secure than spreadsheets. An\ninstitution’s IT team might allow one to access some\ntables within an institution’s data warehouse, but not\nothers. One’s access could be restricted to deﬁned\nsubsets of patients. One might have “read” access to\nthese data, but not “write” access (or “write” access to\nonly some subset of ﬁelds). Databases might likewise\nbe set up such that only users from speciﬁc IP ad-\ndresses or computers may access them. The login\nsystems set up by IT departments for these purposes\ntypically use state of the art encryption algorithms, 2-\nfactor authentication, and the like. In contrast, an\nExcel spreadsheet can be “locked” such that only\nsome ﬁelds are editable. But it is not possible to\nrestrict data access by user. Furthermore, this re-\nstriction is to “write” access only, not to “read” ac-\ncess. It is true that one can “hide” columns in a\nspreadsheet and then lock it, to prevent a given user\nfrom viewing them, but the spreadsheet maintainer\nmust do this manually before distributing the\nspreadsheet (time-consuming and prone to error).",

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

(c) To accommodate all the data in our simple example, a spreadsheet needs to store redundant data (colored in red). The data\nstorage requirements quickly balloon.

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

          "text": "Abstract\nAlthough many researchers talk about a “patient database,” they typically are not referring to a database at all, but instead to a spreadsheet of\ncurated facts about a cohort of patients. This article describes relational database systems and how they differ from spreadsheets. At their core,\nspreadsheets are only capable of describing one-to-one (1:1) relationships. However, this article demonstrates that clinical medical data\nencapsulate numerous one-to-many relationships. Consequently, spreadsheets are very inefﬁcient relative to relational database systems,\nwhich gracefully manage such data. Databases provide other advantages, in that the data ﬁelds are “typed” (that is, they contain speciﬁc\nkinds of data). This prevents users from entering spurious data during data import. Because each record contains a “key,” it becomes\nimpossible to add duplicate information (ie, add the same patient twice). Databases store data in very efﬁcient ways, minimizing space and\nmemory requirements on the host system. Likewise, databases can be queried or manipulated using a highly complex language called\nSQL. Consequently, it becomes trivial to cull large amounts of data from a vast number of data ﬁelds on very precise subsets of patients.\nDatabases can be quite large (terabytes or more in size), yet still are highly efﬁcient to query. Consequently, with the explosion of data\navailable in electronic health records and other data sources, databases become increasingly important to contain or order these data.\nUltimately, this will enable the clinical researcher to perform artiﬁcial intelligence analyses across vast amounts of clinical data in a way\nheretofore impossible. This article provides initial guidance in terms of creating a relational database system.\n(cid:1) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of American Society for Radiation Oncology.

To\naccommodate these data, a spreadsheet quickly balloons in\nsize (Fig 2c).

For instance, in\nthis example, when patient “12345” passes away, the\n“DeathDate” needs to be updated in 5 rows of the spread-\nsheet (because she had 2 courses of radiation therapy and 4\ncycles of chemotherapy). It is not difﬁcult to imagine that a\nresearcher could neglect to update the “DeathDate” in each\nplace, introducing errors. To further expound upon the\nissue, imagine a patient who takes numerous medications or\nhas variable numbers of comorbid illnesses;\nthe rows\nrequired to encapsulate 1 patient explode.

The login\nsystems set up by IT departments for these purposes\ntypically use state of the art encryption algorithms, 2-\nfactor authentication, and the like. In contrast, an\nExcel spreadsheet can be “locked” such that only\nsome ﬁelds are editable. But it is not possible to\nrestrict data access by user. Furthermore, this re-\nstriction is to “write” access only, not to “read” ac-\ncess.

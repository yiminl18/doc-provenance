There are also server-based databases, such as\nMySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle. These software packages\nare all very good and very powerful for multiuser projects with a\nnumber of interacting databases, but they are overkill for a\nresearch project such as the breast cancer tissue array project\ndescribed above.

We enter data directly into the spreadsheet\nwithout using any custom entry form, but it is easy to create one if\nyou feel that data entry would be cleaner by using one, e.g. if\nsomeone without specialist knowledge is entering the data for you.\nIf you need multiuser entry, then a single spreadsheet be-\ncomes problematic because version control becomes very difﬁ-\ncult. In these circumstances, a server-based database is more\nuseful but it can be difﬁcult to arrange access from different in-\nstitutions.

If your raw data item is the\nmaximum diameter of a breast cancer in millimetres and you\nwant to convert that to centimetres in the calculation of the\nNottingham Prognostic Index, then you would simply set up a\nformula such: ¼ A23/10 where A23 is the index of the cell\ncontaining the measurement in millimetres.

Deriving the lymph node status component for the Not-\ntingham Prognostic Index from the total number of positive\nlymph nodes would be more complicated but the conditional\noperators exist in Excel to allow this, e.g. ¼ IF(A23 > 3,2,0), and\nautomatic help boxes make this very easy (click the calculator\nsymbol on the Excel toolbar just to the right of the green tick\nsymbol). It should be noted that these calculated values only\nexist when the other items from which they are derived are still\npresent in the datasheet. If for any reason, such as reducing data\ndown to the core items for statistical analysis, you are going to\nremove columns from the datasheet, you must select the whole\ndatasheet, copy it and then paste it back in the same cells using\nthe Paste Special function and selecting Values. You will then\nhave a sheet in which each cell is an independent number not\ndependent on any other cell.

Too many researchers start with the software choice and\nthen their database design is inﬂuenced by what the software can\ndo, rather than what the software can do for them. There are a\nnumber of popular database software packages on the market,\nsuch as Microsoft Access and Filemaker Pro, which run on indi-\nvidual computers. There are also server-based databases, such as\nMySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle. These software packages\nare all very good and very powerful for multiuser projects with a\nnumber of interacting databases, but they are overkill for a\nresearch project such as the breast cancer tissue array project\ndescribed above. Although we have used Microsoft Access and\nFilemaker Pro in the past with success, the learning curve for using\nthese packages is relatively steep and the results are no better than\nusing our current preferred option which is Microsoft Excel. This\nspreadsheet application has enough database functions built into it\nto carry out all the necessary preprocessing before statistical\nanalysis of results in speciﬁc statistical software package, such as\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). It has the major\nadvantages of virtually no learning curve, if you already use its\nspreadsheet functions, no platform speciﬁcity (Microsoft Access\ndoes not run on Macintosh computers), accepts ﬁles from other\nsources in a wide range of formats, and does not allow the user to\nwaste time creating colourful graphical interfaces for entering data\nthat have no value to the project. We simply create a column for\neach data item and use a row for each case. The ‘Split Window’ and\n‘Freeze Panes’ functions (found under the Windows menu at the\ntop of the screen) allow the column headings and left-hand row\nlabels to remain on the screen all the time no matter how many\nrows or columns there are in the spreadsheet (see the Excel help\nﬁles for further details). We enter data directly into the spreadsheet\nwithout using any custom entry form, but it is easy to create one if\nyou feel that data entry would be cleaner by using one, e.g. if\nsomeone without specialist knowledge is entering the data for you.\nIf you need multiuser entry, then a single spreadsheet be-\ncomes problematic because version control becomes very difﬁ-\ncult. In these circumstances, a server-based database is more\nuseful but it can be difﬁcult to arrange access from different in-\nstitutions. A more recent development is the availability of web-\nbased databases, which are accessible from any web browser and\nmake multiuser data entry very simple.

There are also server-based databases, such as\nMySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle. These software packages\nare all very good and very powerful for multiuser projects with a\nnumber of interacting databases, but they are overkill for a\nresearch project such as the breast cancer tissue array project\ndescribed above. Although we have used Microsoft Access and\nFilemaker Pro in the past with success, the learning curve for using\nthese packages is relatively steep and the results are no better than\nusing our current preferred option which is Microsoft Excel. This\nspreadsheet application has enough database functions built into it\nto carry out all the necessary preprocessing before statistical\nanalysis of results in speciﬁc statistical software package, such as\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS).

We enter data directly into the spreadsheet\nwithout using any custom entry form, but it is easy to create one if\nyou feel that data entry would be cleaner by using one, e.g. if\nsomeone without specialist knowledge is entering the data for you.\nIf you need multiuser entry, then a single spreadsheet be-\ncomes problematic because version control becomes very difﬁ-\ncult. In these circumstances, a server-based database is more\nuseful but it can be difﬁcult to arrange access from different in-\nstitutions.

If your raw data item is the\nmaximum diameter of a breast cancer in millimetres and you\nwant to convert that to centimetres in the calculation of the\nNottingham Prognostic Index, then you would simply set up a\nformula such: ¼ A23/10 where A23 is the index of the cell\ncontaining the measurement in millimetres. It is a simple matter\nto propagate that formula down the whole column for size in\ncentimetres by using the ‘Fill’ ‘Down’ functions from the Edit\nmenu. Deriving the lymph node status component for the Not-\ntingham Prognostic Index from the total number of positive\nlymph nodes would be more complicated but the conditional\noperators exist in Excel to allow this, e.g. ¼ IF(A23 > 3,2,0), and\nautomatic help boxes make this very easy (click the calculator\nsymbol on the Excel toolbar just to the right of the green tick\nsymbol). It should be noted that these calculated values only\nexist when the other items from which they are derived are still\npresent in the datasheet. If for any reason, such as reducing data\ndown to the core items for statistical analysis, you are going to\nremove columns from the datasheet, you must select the whole\ndatasheet, copy it and then paste it back in the same cells using\nthe Paste Special function and selecting Values. You will then\nhave a sheet in which each cell is an independent number not\ndependent on any other cell. Obviously, you should only do this\nwhen you have ﬁnished entering all the data and are ready for\ndata analysis, and you should immediately save this sheet in a\ndifferent name from the original database sheet.",

If your raw data item is the\nmaximum diameter of a breast cancer in millimetres and you\nwant to convert that to centimetres in the calculation of the\nNottingham Prognostic Index, then you would simply set up a\nformula such: ¼ A23/10 where A23 is the index of the cell\ncontaining the measurement in millimetres. It is a simple matter\nto propagate that formula down the whole column for size in\ncentimetres by using the ‘Fill’ ‘Down’ functions from the Edit\nmenu. Deriving the lymph node status component for the Not-\ntingham Prognostic Index from the total number of positive\nlymph nodes would be more complicated but the conditional\noperators exist in Excel to allow this, e.g. ¼ IF(A23 > 3,2,0), and\nautomatic help boxes make this very easy (click the calculator\nsymbol on the Excel toolbar just to the right of the green tick\nsymbol). It should be noted that these calculated values only\nexist when the other items from which they are derived are still\npresent in the datasheet. If for any reason, such as reducing data\ndown to the core items for statistical analysis, you are going to\nremove columns from the datasheet, you must select the whole\ndatasheet, copy it and then paste it back in the same cells using\nthe Paste Special function and selecting Values. You will then\nhave a sheet in which each cell is an independent number not\ndependent on any other cell. Obviously, you should only do this\nwhen you have ﬁnished entering all the data and are ready for\ndata analysis, and you should immediately save this sheet in a\ndifferent name from the original database sheet.",

A much simpler method is to use some identiﬁer\nwhich is not identiﬁable without access to some existing infor-\nmation system. This could be the patient’s hospital number but\nmany ethics committees regard this as relatively insecure\nbecause the patient’s hospital number could open access to a\nwhole range of information in many different hospital informa-\ntion systems (and the patient’s NHS number is even less secure\nand more informative). In histopathology we are fortunate in\nhaving the laboratory accession number which is a restrictive\nsuperﬁcially-anonymous identiﬁer that is only available to those\nwith access to the laboratory information computer system, and\nthat system is already heavily protected by individual password\nlogin, automatic timing out of terminals after a short period of\nnon-use, etc. If we are conducting a research study on archival\ndiagnostic surgical material, then we will probably be using\nslides labelled with the laboratory accession number and we are\nunlikely to anonymize that number because of the slide labelling\nproblems it would cause. At present the ethics committees that\nwe have passed applications through have been happy to use the\nlaboratory accession number to anonymize the samples and data\nin studies, although they have always required a statement on\nthe circumstances in which the investigators would go back to\nthe laboratory information system for more data.

Too many researchers start with the software choice and\nthen their database design is inﬂuenced by what the software can\ndo, rather than what the software can do for them. There are a\nnumber of popular database software packages on the market,\nsuch as Microsoft Access and Filemaker Pro, which run on indi-\nvidual computers. There are also server-based databases, such as\nMySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle. These software packages\nare all very good and very powerful for multiuser projects with a\nnumber of interacting databases, but they are overkill for a\nresearch project such as the breast cancer tissue array project\ndescribed above. Although we have used Microsoft Access and\nFilemaker Pro in the past with success, the learning curve for using\nthese packages is relatively steep and the results are no better than\nusing our current preferred option which is Microsoft Excel. This\nspreadsheet application has enough database functions built into it\nto carry out all the necessary preprocessing before statistical\nanalysis of results in speciﬁc statistical software package, such as\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). It has the major\nadvantages of virtually no learning curve, if you already use its\nspreadsheet functions, no platform speciﬁcity (Microsoft Access\ndoes not run on Macintosh computers), accepts ﬁles from other\nsources in a wide range of formats, and does not allow the user to\nwaste time creating colourful graphical interfaces for entering data\nthat have no value to the project. We simply create a column for\neach data item and use a row for each case. The ‘Split Window’ and\n‘Freeze Panes’ functions (found under the Windows menu at the\ntop of the screen) allow the column headings and left-hand row\nlabels to remain on the screen all the time no matter how many\nrows or columns there are in the spreadsheet (see the Excel help\nﬁles for further details). We enter data directly into the spreadsheet\nwithout using any custom entry form, but it is easy to create one if\nyou feel that data entry would be cleaner by using one, e.g. if\nsomeone without specialist knowledge is entering the data for you.\nIf you need multiuser entry, then a single spreadsheet be-\ncomes problematic because version control becomes very difﬁ-\ncult. In these circumstances, a server-based database is more\nuseful but it can be difﬁcult to arrange access from different in-\nstitutions. A more recent development is the availability of web-\nbased databases, which are accessible from any web browser and\nmake multiuser data entry very simple.

Tables 1 and 2 illustrate these problems and show\nthat the best solution is to create separate columns for each\nelement of a multipart or mixed number/text item. Binary data\nitems, such as gender or lymph node status, are easier but there is\nstill a decision to be made as to whether to use strict mathematical\nbinary code or a more descriptive code.

If your raw data item is the\nmaximum diameter of a breast cancer in millimetres and you\nwant to convert that to centimetres in the calculation of the\nNottingham Prognostic Index, then you would simply set up a\nformula such: ¼ A23/10 where A23 is the index of the cell\ncontaining the measurement in millimetres.

Deriving the lymph node status component for the Not-\ntingham Prognostic Index from the total number of positive\nlymph nodes would be more complicated but the conditional\noperators exist in Excel to allow this, e.g. ¼ IF(A23 > 3,2,0), and\nautomatic help boxes make this very easy (click the calculator\nsymbol on the Excel toolbar just to the right of the green tick\nsymbol). It should be noted that these calculated values only\nexist when the other items from which they are derived are still\npresent in the datasheet. If for any reason, such as reducing data\ndown to the core items for statistical analysis, you are going to\nremove columns from the datasheet, you must select the whole\ndatasheet, copy it and then paste it back in the same cells using\nthe Paste Special function and selecting Values. You will then\nhave a sheet in which each cell is an independent number not\ndependent on any other cell.

This only requires a bit of thought about how\nyou are going to sort and use the data but again if you code your\ndata in appropriate formats it will cause a lot of rework and delay\nlater. The laboratory accession number is a simple illustrative\ncase (Tables 1 and 2). This number is usually in the form of the\nyear and then a single unique number issued in ascending order\nas specimens arrive. There may also be a separate block number if\nthe specimen cannot be embedded in a single block. If such a\nnumber is entered into a single column in its usual format, e.g.\n08/23156/3E, it will be treated as text rather than a number in\nExcel and there can be a number of problems when sorting data\nfor analysis. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate these problems and show\nthat the best solution is to create separate columns for each\nelement of a multipart or mixed number/text item. Binary data\nitems, such as gender or lymph node status, are easier but there is\nstill a decision to be made as to whether to use strict mathematical\nbinary code or a more descriptive code. Gender could be coded as\n1 ¼ female and 0 ¼ male, but this is an arbitrary coding that is not\nmemorable to the data inputer. Coding as f ¼ female and m ¼\nmale is memorable and so far lower rates of errors are likely\nduring the inputting of the data, i.e. make the purest possible\ntransformations of data. It is a very simple automated ‘ﬁnd and\nreplace’ function to convert these to true mathematical binary\nitems for statistical analysis. It is well worth keeping descriptive\ncodings as short as possible, because this reduces the number of\nkeystrokes when entering data. The autoﬁll function of Excel is",

This can be done using Excel’s calculation\nfunctions and the reader is referred to Excel help ﬁles or\ninstructional books for the details of this.5 Obviously some cal-\nculations are easier than others. If your raw data item is the\nmaximum diameter of a breast cancer in millimetres and you\nwant to convert that to centimetres in the calculation of the\nNottingham Prognostic Index, then you would simply set up a\nformula such: ¼ A23/10 where A23 is the index of the cell\ncontaining the measurement in millimetres. It is a simple matter\nto propagate that formula down the whole column for size in\ncentimetres by using the ‘Fill’ ‘Down’ functions from the Edit\nmenu. Deriving the lymph node status component for the Not-\ntingham Prognostic Index from the total number of positive\nlymph nodes would be more complicated but the conditional\noperators exist in Excel to allow this, e.g. ¼ IF(A23 > 3,2,0), and\nautomatic help boxes make this very easy (click the calculator\nsymbol on the Excel toolbar just to the right of the green tick\nsymbol). It should be noted that these calculated values only\nexist when the other items from which they are derived are still\npresent in the datasheet. If for any reason, such as reducing data\ndown to the core items for statistical analysis, you are going to\nremove columns from the datasheet, you must select the whole\ndatasheet, copy it and then paste it back in the same cells using\nthe Paste Special function and selecting Values. You will then\nhave a sheet in which each cell is an independent number not\ndependent on any other cell. Obviously, you should only do this\nwhen you have ﬁnished entering all the data and are ready for\ndata analysis, and you should immediately save this sheet in a\ndifferent name from the original database sheet.",

A much simpler method is to use some identiﬁer\nwhich is not identiﬁable without access to some existing infor-\nmation system. This could be the patient’s hospital number but\nmany ethics committees regard this as relatively insecure\nbecause the patient’s hospital number could open access to a\nwhole range of information in many different hospital informa-\ntion systems (and the patient’s NHS number is even less secure\nand more informative). In histopathology we are fortunate in\nhaving the laboratory accession number which is a restrictive\nsuperﬁcially-anonymous identiﬁer that is only available to those\nwith access to the laboratory information computer system, and\nthat system is already heavily protected by individual password\nlogin, automatic timing out of terminals after a short period of\nnon-use, etc. If we are conducting a research study on archival\ndiagnostic surgical material, then we will probably be using\nslides labelled with the laboratory accession number and we are\nunlikely to anonymize that number because of the slide labelling\nproblems it would cause. At present the ethics committees that\nwe have passed applications through have been happy to use the\nlaboratory accession number to anonymize the samples and data\nin studies, although they have always required a statement on\nthe circumstances in which the investigators would go back to\nthe laboratory information system for more data. Such consid-\nerations always have to be made for any research project and are\nnot exclusively a feature of research databases.",

This only requires a bit of thought about how\nyou are going to sort and use the data but again if you code your\ndata in appropriate formats it will cause a lot of rework and delay\nlater. The laboratory accession number is a simple illustrative\ncase (Tables 1 and 2). This number is usually in the form of the\nyear and then a single unique number issued in ascending order\nas specimens arrive. There may also be a separate block number if\nthe specimen cannot be embedded in a single block. If such a\nnumber is entered into a single column in its usual format, e.g.\n08/23156/3E, it will be treated as text rather than a number in\nExcel and there can be a number of problems when sorting data\nfor analysis. Tables 1 and 2 illustrate these problems and show\nthat the best solution is to create separate columns for each\nelement of a multipart or mixed number/text item. Binary data\nitems, such as gender or lymph node status, are easier but there is\nstill a decision to be made as to whether to use strict mathematical\nbinary code or a more descriptive code. Gender could be coded as\n1 ¼ female and 0 ¼ male, but this is an arbitrary coding that is not\nmemorable to the data inputer. Coding as f ¼ female and m ¼\nmale is memorable and so far lower rates of errors are likely\nduring the inputting of the data, i.e. make the purest possible\ntransformations of data. It is a very simple automated ‘ﬁnd and\nreplace’ function to convert these to true mathematical binary\nitems for statistical analysis. It is well worth keeping descriptive\ncodings as short as possible, because this reduces the number of\nkeystrokes when entering data. The autoﬁll function of Excel is",

Too many researchers start with the software choice and\nthen their database design is inﬂuenced by what the software can\ndo, rather than what the software can do for them. There are a\nnumber of popular database software packages on the market,\nsuch as Microsoft Access and Filemaker Pro, which run on indi-\nvidual computers. There are also server-based databases, such as\nMySQL, Microsoft SQL Server or Oracle. These software packages\nare all very good and very powerful for multiuser projects with a\nnumber of interacting databases, but they are overkill for a\nresearch project such as the breast cancer tissue array project\ndescribed above. Although we have used Microsoft Access and\nFilemaker Pro in the past with success, the learning curve for using\nthese packages is relatively steep and the results are no better than\nusing our current preferred option which is Microsoft Excel. This\nspreadsheet application has enough database functions built into it\nto carry out all the necessary preprocessing before statistical\nanalysis of results in speciﬁc statistical software package, such as\nStatistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). It has the major\nadvantages of virtually no learning curve, if you already use its\nspreadsheet functions, no platform speciﬁcity (Microsoft Access\ndoes not run on Macintosh computers), accepts ﬁles from other\nsources in a wide range of formats, and does not allow the user to\nwaste time creating colourful graphical interfaces for entering data\nthat have no value to the project. We simply create a column for\neach data item and use a row for each case. The ‘Split Window’ and\n‘Freeze Panes’ functions (found under the Windows menu at the\ntop of the screen) allow the column headings and left-hand row\nlabels to remain on the screen all the time no matter how many\nrows or columns there are in the spreadsheet (see the Excel help\nﬁles for further details). We enter data directly into the spreadsheet\nwithout using any custom entry form, but it is easy to create one if\nyou feel that data entry would be cleaner by using one, e.g. if\nsomeone without specialist knowledge is entering the data for you.\nIf you need multiuser entry, then a single spreadsheet be-\ncomes problematic because version control becomes very difﬁ-\ncult. In these circumstances, a server-based database is more\nuseful but it can be difﬁcult to arrange access from different in-\nstitutions. A more recent development is the availability of web-\nbased databases, which are accessible from any web browser and\nmake multiuser data entry very simple.

This can be done using Excel’s calculation\nfunctions and the reader is referred to Excel help ﬁles or\ninstructional books for the details of this.5 Obviously some cal-\nculations are easier than others. If your raw data item is the\nmaximum diameter of a breast cancer in millimetres and you\nwant to convert that to centimetres in the calculation of the\nNottingham Prognostic Index, then you would simply set up a\nformula such: ¼ A23/10 where A23 is the index of the cell\ncontaining the measurement in millimetres. It is a simple matter\nto propagate that formula down the whole column for size in\ncentimetres by using the ‘Fill’ ‘Down’ functions from the Edit\nmenu. Deriving the lymph node status component for the Not-\ntingham Prognostic Index from the total number of positive\nlymph nodes would be more complicated but the conditional\noperators exist in Excel to allow this, e.g. ¼ IF(A23 > 3,2,0), and\nautomatic help boxes make this very easy (click the calculator\nsymbol on the Excel toolbar just to the right of the green tick\nsymbol). It should be noted that these calculated values only\nexist when the other items from which they are derived are still\npresent in the datasheet. If for any reason, such as reducing data\ndown to the core items for statistical analysis, you are going to\nremove columns from the datasheet, you must select the whole\ndatasheet, copy it and then paste it back in the same cells using\nthe Paste Special function and selecting Values. You will then\nhave a sheet in which each cell is an independent number not\ndependent on any other cell. Obviously, you should only do this\nwhen you have ﬁnished entering all the data and are ready for\ndata analysis, and you should immediately save this sheet in a\ndifferent name from the original database sheet.",

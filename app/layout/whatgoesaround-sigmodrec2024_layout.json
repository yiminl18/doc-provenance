Google argued that with care-\nful engineering, a MR system will beat DBMSs, and a\nuser does not have to load data with a schema before\nrunning queries on it. Thus, MR is better for “one shot”\ntasks, such as text processing and ETL operations. The\nDBMS community argued that MR incurs performance\nproblems due to its design that existing parallel DBMSs\nalready solved. Furthermore, the use of higher-level\nlanguages (SQL) operating over partitioned tables has\nproven to be a good programming model [127].",

SQL:1999 introduced limited sup-\nport for single-dimension, ﬁxed-length array data types.\nSQL:2003 expanded to support nested arrays without a\npredeﬁned maximum cardinality. Later entrants include\nOracle Georaster [4] and Teradata [73]. Data cubes are\nspecial-purpose arrays [135], but columnar RDBMSs\nhave eclipsed them for OLAP workloads because of\ntheir better ﬂexibility and lower engineering costs [113].\nMore recently, the SQL:2023 standard includes sup-\nport for true multi-dimensional arrays (SQL/MDA) that\nis heavily inspired by Rasdaman’s RQL [166]. This\nupdate allows SQL to represent arrays with arbitrary\nIn effect,\ndimensions using integer-based coordinates.\nthis allows data cubes to exist in a SQL framework, but\ncolumnar DBMSs now dominate this market.",

Many appli-\ncations use knowledge graphs to model semi-structured\ninformation. Social media applications inherently con-\ntain graph-oriented relationships (“likes”, “friend-of”).\nRelational design tools provide users with an entity-\nrelationship (ER) model of their database. An ER dia-\ngram is a graph; thus, this paradigm has clear use cases.\nThe two most prevalent approaches to represent graphs\nare (1) the resource description framework (RDF) and\n(2) property graphs [126]. With property graphs, the\nDBMS maintains a directed multi-graph structure that\nsupports key/value labels for nodes and edges. RDF\ndatabases (aka triplestores) only model a directed graph\nwith labeled edges. Since property graphs are more com-\nmon and are a superset of RDF, we will only discuss\nthem. We consider two use cases for graph DBMSs and\ndiscuss the problems that will limit their adoption.",

But over the last 20 years, networking band-\nwidth has increased much faster than disk bandwidth,\nmaking network attached storage (NAS) attractive as an\nalternative to attached storage. This has caused a pro-\nfound rethinking of DBMS architectures for the cloud.\nAll major cloud vendors offer NAS via object stores\n(e.g., Amazon S3) with some DBMS functionality (e.g.,\nreplication, ﬁltering). Beyond better economics com-\npared to direct-attached storage, object stores have sev-\neral advantages that compensate for the cost of the\nadded network link. First, because the compute nodes\nare disconnected from the storage nodes, a system can\nprovide per-query elasticity; the DBMS can add new\ncompute nodes dynamically without having to reshufﬂe\ndata.\nIt also allows the DBMS to use different hard-\nware for its storage nodes than compute nodes. Second,\nthe system can reassign compute nodes to other tasks\nif a DBMS is underutilized. On the other hand, in a\nshared-nothing DBMS, a node must always be online to\nhandle incoming query requests. Lastly, pushing down\ncomputation into the storage nodes is possible (and gen-\nerally advantageous). This execution strategy is known\nas “pushing the query to the data” versus “pulling the\ndata to the query” and is well understood in DBMSs.",

That paper demonstrated\nthat the relational model (RM) and SQL are the prevail-\ning choice for database management systems (DBMSs),\ndespite efforts to replace either them. Instead, SQL ab-\nsorbed the best ideas from these alternative approaches.\nWe revisit this issue and argue that this same evolu-\ntion has continued since 2005. Once again there have\nbeen repeated efforts to replace either SQL or the RM.\nBut the RM continues to be the dominant data model\nand SQL has been extended to capture the good ideas\nfrom others. As such, we expect more of the same in\nthe future, namely the continued evolution of SQL and\nrelational DBMSs (RDBMSs). We also discuss DBMS\nimplementations and argue that the major advancements\nhave been in the RM systems, primarily driven by chang-\ning hardware characteristics.",

But over the last 20 years, networking band-\nwidth has increased much faster than disk bandwidth,\nmaking network attached storage (NAS) attractive as an\nalternative to attached storage. This has caused a pro-\nfound rethinking of DBMS architectures for the cloud.\nAll major cloud vendors offer NAS via object stores\n(e.g., Amazon S3) with some DBMS functionality (e.g.,\nreplication, ﬁltering). Beyond better economics com-\npared to direct-attached storage, object stores have sev-\neral advantages that compensate for the cost of the\nadded network link. First, because the compute nodes\nare disconnected from the storage nodes, a system can\nprovide per-query elasticity; the DBMS can add new\ncompute nodes dynamically without having to reshufﬂe\ndata.\nIt also allows the DBMS to use different hard-\nware for its storage nodes than compute nodes. Second,\nthe system can reassign compute nodes to other tasks\nif a DBMS is underutilized. On the other hand, in a\nshared-nothing DBMS, a node must always be online to\nhandle incoming query requests. Lastly, pushing down\ncomputation into the storage nodes is possible (and gen-\nerally advantageous). This execution strategy is known\nas “pushing the query to the data” versus “pulling the\ndata to the query” and is well understood in DBMSs.",

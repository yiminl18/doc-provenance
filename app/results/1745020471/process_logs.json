of self-tracking practices target the", "[16:54:38] domain  of  health  and  well-being  [11],  where  models  are  fairly", "[16:54:38] simple: a step is a step, the number  of heart pulsations, and

body  of", "[16:54:38] knowledge about how people reason in practice about this type", "[16:54:38] of data.2  Method and Settings", "[16:54:38] In  order  to  study  how  people  understand  and  accept  figures  of", "[16:54:38] CO2  emissions  and  costs  due  to  commuting,  a  diary  study  has", "[16:54:38] been  conducted.We  have  chosen  this  methodology  as  it  is", "[16:54:38] difficult  to  gather  information  on  commuting  practices  through", "[16:54:38] observation over a long period of time.We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a", "[16:54:38] snowball  sampling.The  ages  varied  from  27  to  56.Our", "[16:54:38] participants  were  all  professionals,  qualified  as  engineers,", "[16:54:38] computer  scientists,  doctors,  technicians,  school  teachers  and", "[16:54:38] sales assistants.The  diary  study  was  divided  into  three  main  steps.The  first", "[16:54:38] one  was  a  face-to-face  semi-directed", "[16:54:38] interview  with  the", "[16:54:38] participants  where  they  described  precisely  their  commuting", "[16:54:38] practices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing", "[16:54:38] a given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that", "[16:54:38] they  may  have  for  one  or  another  means  of  transport  and  the", "[16:54:38] constraints they may have in their professional or personal lives", "[16:54:38] for commuting.In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen", "[16:54:38] and paper diary during 20 working days.Each day, they had to", "[16:54:38] indicate  the  date, the  means  of transport  used  that  day  and  the", "[16:54:38] reason why they made that choice, if any.After the 20 days, the", "[16:54:38] participants  returned  their  diaries  and  we  were  then  able  to", "[16:54:38] compute all the figures regarding the cost and CO2 emissions of", "[16:54:38] their commuting.The computation of the financial cost and CO2", "[16:54:38] emission  figures  was  manually  performed  and  based  on  typical", "[16:54:38] carbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the", "[16:54:38] study  [10],  indicated  as  the  eco-calculator  in  the  rest  of  the", "[16:54:38] paper.The third part of the study was a second interview with the", "[16:54:38] participants, where we provided them with a compacted view of", "[16:54:38] their commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day,", "[16:54:38] we  represent  for  the  user  the  means  of  transport  used  to go  to", "[16:54:38] commute.We also shared with the participants a representation", "[16:54:38] Cecile Boulard et al.of  the  financial  costs  and  CO2  emissions  for  each  day.All  the", "[16:54:38] figures  produced  on  the  commuting  of  the  participants  were", "[16:54:38] presented  to  them  during  interviews  with  all  the  required", "[16:54:38] explanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.The goal", "[16:54:38] of the second interview was to provide the participants with the", "[16:54:38] compiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those", "[16:54:38] figures  made  them  think  about  their  commuting  practices  and", "[16:54:38] choices.We  audio-recorded  all  interviews  and  collected  participants\u2019", "[16:54:38] diary  entries.All  the  interviews  were  entirely  transcribed  and", "[16:54:38] analyzed together with the diaries.We identified themes using a", "[16:54:38] thematic  analysis  [7].For  this  study,  we  inductively  identified", "[16:54:38] themes  starting  from  the  data  trying  to  find  commonalities", "[16:54:38] representation  of", "[16:54:38] rather", "[16:54:38] understanding.We describe our findings in next section.a  pre-existing", "[16:54:38] than  having", "[16:54:38] 3  Findings", "[16:54:38] During  the  analysis,  the  emerging  central  theme  was  related to", "[16:54:38] the  difficulties  that  participants  faced  during  the  interview  in", "[16:54:38] understanding  and  accepting  the  figures  emerging  from  their", "[16:54:38] commuting habits.The eco-calculator model takes a socially and", "[16:54:38] politically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it", "[16:54:38] to measurable reference units like CO2 emissions and cost.Even", "[16:54:38] within  a  sample  of  people  with  a  clear  disposition  towards", "[16:54:38] questioning  their  own  environmental  impact  and  their  habits,", "[16:54:38] there  was  a  tendency  to  perceive  the  figures  as  incomplete  and", "[16:54:38] possibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into", "[16:54:38] actionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices", "[16:54:38] vis-a-vis", "[16:54:38] them", "[16:54:38] specifically.transportation  options  available", "[16:54:38] the", "[16:54:38] to", "[16:54:38] The findings that we report here come from the last phase of", "[16:54:38] the study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to", "[16:54:38] the participants\u2019 feedback on their commuting practices.3.1 Understanding the data", "[16:54:38] 3.1.1  Grasping abstract quantities.As  already  reported  in  [12],", "[16:54:38] when  facing  data  without  having  access  to  information  on  the", "[16:54:38] context  or  to  a  baseline,  users  may  struggle  to  make  sense  of", "[16:54:38] them.A difficulty we observed was in positioning CO2 emission", "[16:54:38] figures on some kind of directional scale \u2013 i.e.is it a little or a lot,", "[16:54:38] good  or  bad,  and  in  relation  to  what?For  instance,  after  the", "[16:54:38] researcher  told  P6  that  she  emitted  4000g  of  CO2  per  day,  she", "[16:54:38] asked  and  commented:  \u201cIs  it  quite  good?I  can\u2019t  appreciate  it.\u201d", "[16:54:38] (P6).This  is  an  issue  as  it  does  not  support  users  in  taking", "[16:54:38] actions  to  change  their  behaviors  toward  greener  practices.It", "[16:54:38] demonstrates  that  there  is  a  need  to  build  a  baseline  of  CO2", "[16:54:38] emissions  in  order  to  help  users  to  position  their  (commuting)", "[16:54:38] practices also with respect to other people and for comparing the", "[16:54:38] different options available in terms of means of transport.3.1.2  Understanding  the  model.Alongside  the  difficulty  in", "[16:54:38] contextualizing  abstract  quantities  on  a  (potentially  normative)", "[16:54:38] scale,  users  also  faced  a  challenge  in  understanding  what  the", "[16:54:38] model actually took into account and what it left out.This can be", "[16:54:38] an  issue  when  it  comes  to  the  perceived  (un)fairness  of  the", "[16:54:38] model  (which  we  will  discuss  later),  but  also  when  weighting", "[16:54:38] 145\f\u201cI Don\u2019t Understand\u2026\u201d Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting", "[16:54:38] financial  costs  against  environmental  impact.P7  who  was", "[16:54:38] mainly  riding  a  bike  or  using  the  tramway  to  go  to  work,  and", "[16:54:38] only  occasionally  using  the  car,  identified  some  limits  of  the", "[16:54:38] costs  representation,  presented  during  the  second  interview:  \u201cI", "[16:54:38] changed the tires on my bike during the course of the study.It was", "[16:54:38] necessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.\u201d (P7)", "[16:54:38] Because the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned", "[16:54:38] means of transport were not included in the costs computed by", "[16:54:38] the  eco-calculator  the  numbers  presented  to  P7  were  perceived", "[16:54:38] as not complete.In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport,", "[16:54:38] questioned  the  cost  associated  to  the  monthly  pass.As  she", "[16:54:38] explained:  \u201cthen  there  is  a  small  correction  factor  that  can  refine", "[16:54:38] the  calculation  of  the  cost,  that  is  that  you  consider  only  the", "[16:54:38] working days  whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end\u201d.Here,  P3  meant  that  the  choice  of  dividing  the  price  of  the", "[16:54:38] monthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.the working days, did not fit", "[16:54:38] with  her  representation  of  cost of  the  monthly  pass.For  her,  it", "[16:54:38] meant  that  she  could  get  in  a  bus  or  tram  anytime,  any  day  in", "[16:54:38] the  month  and  so  the  cost  of  this  pass  should  have  been", "[16:54:38] computed over the 30 days of the month.She explained that this", "[16:54:38] would  have  seemed  fairer  to  the  representation  that  she  had  of", "[16:54:38] the cost associated to the monthly pass.The  last  situation  we  highlight  in  this  section  refers  to  P10", "[16:54:38] who  got  used  to  go  to  work  with  a  combination  of  means  of", "[16:54:38] transport:  bus  and  kick  scooter.\u201cSo in the end the combination", "[16:54:38] bus  +  kick  scooter  is  more  expensive  than  the  one  with  the  car?I", "[16:54:38] don\u2019t  understand.\u201d  P10  expressed  the  incoherence  that  he", "[16:54:38] perceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own", "[16:54:38] representation of costs.After this feedback, the researcher had to", "[16:54:38] explain  and  detail  what  is  in  the  cost  associated  to  driving  (in", "[16:54:38] this case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the", "[16:54:38] combination  bus  +  kick  scooter  (the  cost  of  one  bus  ticket).As", "[16:54:38] the  distance  home-work  is  relatively  small  for  P10  (less  than", "[16:54:38] 8km),  and  he  had  a  small  car  with  a  low  fuel  consumption,  the", "[16:54:38] cost  of  the  fuel  for  8  km  was  less  than  a  ticket  in  the  bus.The", "[16:54:38] limit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of", "[16:54:38] the car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and", "[16:54:38] driving) a car is much higher than that.3.2 Accepting the data", "[16:54:38] 3.2.1  When  the  model  fails  to  represent  specific  situations.The", "[16:54:38] main objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices", "[16:54:38] with  a  diary  was  to  get  a  first  evaluation  of  what  could  be  its", "[16:54:38] role,  if  any,  in  incentivizing  users  to  adopt  greener  means  of", "[16:54:38] transport.It  is  therefore  critical  that  the  data  is  not  only", "[16:54:38] understandable,  as  discussed  in  the  previous  section,  but  also", "[16:54:39] perceived  as  fair.Tracking  data  about  CO2  emissions  singles", "[16:54:39] individuals  and  families  out  and  questions  their  habits  (and", "[16:54:39] potentially their privileges) vis-\u00e0-vis a global problem.But to do", "[16:54:39] so effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize", "[16:54:39] the  behavior  of  individuals  and  family  units  within  the  overall", "[16:54:39] environmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan", "[16:54:39] area,

showing", "[16:54:39] that  there  were  less  CO2  emissions  with  car-sharing  than  with", "[16:54:39] the  bus.When  the  researcher  explained  that  to  P9,  he  was", "[16:54:39] surprised  and  said:  \u201cAh\u2026 I emitted less CO2 in  car-sharing than in", "[16:54:39] bus\u201d.The  researcher explained  again  how  the  emissions  of  CO2", "[16:54:39] for public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits", "[16:54:39] 103,3  g  of  CO2  per  km).In  a  similar  situation,  P5  said  \u201cwhich", "[16:54:39] would  mean  that  car-sharing  would  produce  less

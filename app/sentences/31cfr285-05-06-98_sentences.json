  "ACTION: Final rule. SUMMARY: This final rule implements\nthe administrative wage garnishment\nprovisions contained in the Debt\nCollection Improvement Act of 1996\n(DCIA).",
  "Wage garnishment is a process\nwhereby an employer withholds\namounts from an employee’s wages and\npays those amounts to the employee’s\ncreditor in satisfaction of a withholding\norder.",
  "The DCIA authorizes Federal\nagencies administratively to garnish the\ndisposable pay of an individual to\ncollect delinquent nontax debts owed to\nthe United States in accordance with\nregulations issued by the Secretary of\nthe Treasury.",
  "DATES: This rule is effective June 5,\n1998.",

  "SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nBackground\n\nThis final rule implements the wage\n\ngarnishment provision in section\n31001(o) of the Debt Collection\nImprovement Act of 1996 (DCIA), Pub.",
  "L. 104–134, 110 Stat. 1321–358 (Apr.",
  "26,\n1996), codified at 31 U.S.C. 3720D.",
  "Wage garnishment is a process whereby\nan employer withholds amounts from\nan employee’s wages and pays those\namounts to the employee’s creditor in\nsatisfaction of a withholding order.",
  "The\nDCIA authorizes Federal agencies\nadministratively to garnish up to 15% of\nthe disposable pay of a debtor to satisfy\ndelinquent nontax debt owed to the\nUnited States.",
  "Prior to the enactment of\nthe DCIA, agencies were required to\nobtain a court judgment before\ngarnishing the wages of non-Federal\nemployees.",
  "Section 31001(o) of the\nDCIA preempts State laws that prohibit\nwage garnishment or otherwise govern\nwage garnishment procedures.",
  "As authorized by the DCIA, a Federal\n\nagency collecting delinquent nontax\ndebt may garnish administratively a\ndelinquent debtor’s wages in accordance\nwith regulations promulgated by the\nSecretary of the Treasury.",
  "The Financial\nManagement Service (FMS), a bureau of\nthe Department of the Treasury, is\nresponsible for promulgating the\nregulations implementing this and other\ndebt collection tools established by the\nDCIA.",
  "In accordance with the requirements\nof the DCIA, this final rule establishes\nthe following rules and procedures:\n\n1.",
  "Notice\n\nAt least 30 days before an agency\ninitiates garnishment proceedings, the\nagency will give the debtor written\nnotice informing him or her of the\nnature and amount of the debt, the\nintention of the agency to collect the\ndebt through deductions from pay, and\nan explanation of the debtor’s rights\nregarding the proposed action.",
  "2. Rights of the Debtor\n\nThe agency will provide the debtor\nwith an opportunity to inspect and copy\nrecords related to the debt, to establish\na repayment agreement, and to receive\na hearing concerning the existence or\namount of the debt and the terms of a\nrepayment schedule.",
  "A hearing must be\nheld prior to the issuance of a\nwithholding order if the debtor’s request\nis timely received.",
  "For hearing requests\nthat are not received in the specified\ntime frame, an agency need not delay\nissuance of the withholding order prior\nto conducting a hearing.",
  "An agency may\nnot garnish the wages of a debtor who\nhas been involuntarily separated from\nemployment until that individual has\nbeen reemployed continuously for at\nleast 12 months.",
  "The debtor bears the\nburden of informing the agency of the\ncircumstances surrounding an\ninvoluntary separation from\nemployment. 3.",
  "Employer’s Responsibilities\n\nThe agency will send to the employer\n\nof a delinquent debtor a wage\ngarnishment order directing that the\nemployer pay a portion of the debtor’s\nwages to the Federal Government.",
  "This\nfinal rule requires the debtor’s employer\nto certify certain payment information\nabout the debtor.",
  "Employers will not be\nrequired to vary their normal pay cycles\nin order to comply with the garnishment\norder.",
  "The DCIA prohibits employers from\ntaking disciplinary actions against the\ndebtor based on the fact that the debtor’s\nwages are subject to administrative\ngarnishment.",
  "In addition, the DCIA\n\nauthorizes an agency to sue an employer\nfor amounts not properly withheld from\nthe wages payable to the debtor.",
  "Discussion of Comments\n\nGeneral\n\nIn response to its Notice of Proposed\n\nRulemaking (NPRM) concerning\nAdministrative Wage Garnishment (62\nFR 62458, Nov. 21, 1997), FMS received\ncomments from Federal agencies,\nprivate collection agencies, an umbrella\norganization for organizations that\nsupport the activities of the Federal\nFamily Education Loan Programs, and a\nprivate citizen.",
  "Many of the commenters\nhave been involved in implementing a\nsimilar administrative wage\ngarnishment provision that authorizes\nthe U.S. Department of Education\n(Education) to garnish 10% of the\ndisposable pay of employed individuals\nwho have defaulted on their student\nloan obligations.",
  "See 20 U.S.C. 1095a;\n34 CFR 682.410.",
  "FMS drafted the NPRM\nafter consultation with the Departments\nof Education and Justice about their\nexperience implementing wage\ngarnishment to collect student loans.",
  "The comments received in response to\nthe NPRM based on the commenters’\nexperience with Education’s program\nhave been helpful in drafting the final\nrule.",
  "It is important to note that\nEducation’s wage garnishment program\nis applicable to the collection of one\ntype of debt subject to a single statutory\nscheme.",
  "The DCIA wage garnishment\nprovision and this rule, on the other\nhand, are applicable to all Federal\nagencies collecting all types of debt, the\ncollection of which is subject to a\nvariety of statutory provisions.",
  "Therefore, as explained below, while\nsome of the suggestions have been\nincorporated into the final rule, others\ndo not apply to a government-wide\nwage garnishment program involving all\nFederal agencies with various types of\ndebts.",
  "A review of the comments is provided\n\nin the following Comment Analysis\nwhich includes a discussion of FMS’\ndetermination whether to incorporate\nspecific suggestions in the final rule.",
  "The Comment Analysis is organized by\nreference to the paragraphs in the\nNPRM.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(a) Purpose\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(a).",
  "FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(b) Scope\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\nincorrectly interpreted the DCIA in the\nNPRM by not limiting the applicability\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.",
  "87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25137\n\nof administrative wage garnishment to\nthe collection of only those debts\nevidenced by written agreements.",
  "The\ncommenter believes that the language\ncontained in 31 U.S.C.",
  "3720D(a)\nauthorizing wage garnishment ‘‘if the\nindividual is not currently making\nrequired repayment in accordance with\nany agreement between the agency head\nand the individual’’ so limits the use of\nwage garnishment.",
  "FMS disagrees with\nthe commenter.",
  "There is nothing in the\nplain language of the statute to indicate\nthat the referenced phrase limits the\napplicability of wage garnishment to\ndebts evidenced by a written agreement.",
  "The term ‘‘debt,’’ as defined in 31 U.S.C.",
  "3701(b)(1), as amended by the DCIA, is\nnot limited to debts evidenced by a\nwritten agreement between the debtor\nand the Government.",
  "One commenter suggested that the\nrule establish a minimum threshold\namount for garnishment based on a cost\nestimate of the garnishment procedure.",
  "This is unnecessary since the use of the\nadministrative wage garnishment tool\nby agencies is voluntary and should be\nused by agencies in appropriate\nsituations.",
  "Agencies may set their own\npolicies regarding minimum thresholds.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(c) Definitions\n\nOne commenter suggested that the\n\ndefinition of agency under NPRM\n§ 285.11(c) be expanded to authorize\nagents or vendors of Federal agencies to\ngarnish debtors’ wages in accordance\nwith this rule.",
  "Whether or not an agent\nor vendor can perform a particular\nfunction on behalf of a Federal agency\nis beyond the scope of this rule.",
  "While\nthe use of contractors for the collection\nof debt generally is authorized by law,\nagencies may not contract out\n‘‘inherently governmental functions.’’\nSee Office of Management and Budget\n(OMB) Circular A–76.",
  "This is not to say\nthat contractors cannot assist agencies\nin conducting administrative wage\ngarnishment.",
  "For example, contractors\ncould be hired to mail notices and\ngarnishment orders authorized by the\nagency, receive documents from the\ndebtor and the employer, and document\nagency-approved repayment agreements\nwith the debtor.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(d) General Rule\n\nOne commenter suggested that FMS\n\nclarify a statement in the NPRM\npreamble concerning NPRM § 285.11(d)\ninvolving the use of wage garnishment\nby Treasury-designated debt collection\ncenters.",
  "In addition to agencies that\nadminister the program that gives rise to\nthe debt, agencies that pursue the\nrecovery of the debt for those agencies,\nsuch as the Department of the Treasury,\n\nTreasury-designated debt collection\ncenters, and the Department of Justice,\nare authorized to conduct\nadministrative wage garnishment.",
  "See,\ne.g., the definition of ‘‘agency’’ in NPRM\n§ 285.11(c), unchanged in the final rule.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(e) Notice\nRequirements\n\nThe suggestion by one commenter\nthat the rule specifically prohibit the\ncombination of an agency’s notice of\nintention to garnish a debtor’s wages\nwith other notices to the debtor has not\nbeen incorporated into this rule.",
  "The\nrule gives agencies the flexibility to\ncombine notices where appropriate.",
  "In\nmany circumstances, the debtor can be\ninformed clearly in a single\ncommunication of all debt collection\nremedies available to the Federal agency\nand the opportunities available to the\ndebtor to be heard concerning the\nexistence or amount of the debt.",
  "One commenter’s suggestion that FMS\ndevelop a standard administrative wage\ngarnishment notice for government-\nwide use has not been incorporated in\nthe final rule.",
  "Because agency-specific\nlaws applicable to debt collection have\nto be considered in drafting a notice, a\nstandard government-wide form would\nnot be appropriate.",
  "One commenter suggested that the\n\nrule exempt private collection\nprofessionals acting on behalf of\nagencies from the liability provisions of\nthe Fair Debt Collection Practices Act\n(FDCPA), 15 U.S.C.",
  "1692 et seq.,\nprovided that such entities comply with\nthe terms of this rule and use notices\nand forms developed by Treasury or\nother agencies.",
  "The extent to which the\nFDCPA may apply to any entity,\nparticularly private collection agencies,\nis outside the scope of this rule.",
  "Several commenters suggested that\n\nthe rule should clearly state that the\ncertificate of service may be retained\nelectronically.",
  "Other commenters\nsuggested that a certificate of service is\nunnecessary.",
  "The final rule retains the\nrequirement that an agency keep a\ncertificate of service as evidence of\nmailing.",
  "However, NPRM\n§§ 285.11(e)(3) and 285.11(g)(3) have\nbeen amended to indicate more clearly\nthat the certificate of service may be\nretained electronically so long as the\nmanner of retention is sufficient for\nevidentiary purposes.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(f) Hearing\n\nOne Federal agency asked that the\nrule address whether an agency needs to\npublish its own regulation before it can\nengage in administrative wage\ngarnishment under the DCIA.",
  "Another\ncommenter questioned how an agency’s\n\nexisting hearing procedures for debt\ndetermination relate to the wage\ngarnishment requirements contained in\nthe DCIA and NPRM.",
  "The phrase\n‘‘consistent with this section’’ was\nadded to NPRM § 285.11(f)(1) in this\nfinal rule to clarify that agency\nregulations must follow the minimum\nrequirements for wage garnishment\nhearings as set forth in this rule.",
  "Each\nagency is responsible for prescribing\nhearing procedures in accordance with\nthe statutory and regulatory\nrequirements of this rule and other\nrequirements applicable to that agency’s\ndebt collection hearing procedures.",
  "Those agencies with hearings\nprocedures which meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand agency-specific statutory and other\nrequirements need not develop new\nhearing procedures.",
  "Agencies should\nseek legal advice from their agency\ncounsel to determine whether existing\nagency procedures meet the\nrequirements established under this rule\nand whether the agency is required to\npublish new or amended regulations.",
  "Section 285.11(b)(6) has been added to\nthe final rule to further clarify that\n‘‘(n)othing in this section requires\nagencies to duplicate notices or\nadministrative proceedings required by\ncontract or other laws or regulations.’’\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that the\nDepartment of the Treasury or the\nDepartment of Justice be required to\nreview agencies’ wage garnishment\nprocedures and regulations prior to\nallowing an agency to initiate a wage\ngarnishment program.",
  "Unique statutory\nrequirements apply to every Federal\nprogram that gives rise to delinquent\ndebt.",
  "Thus, the agency administering\nthe program that gives rise to the debt\nis in the best position to know what is\nrequired.",
  "The Departments of Treasury\nand Justice will continue, however, to\nprovide guidance to agencies\nconcerning debt collection practices and\nprocedures.",
  "One commenter recommended\namending NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) by\nestablishing that a debtor has 15\n‘‘calendar’’ days, rather than 15\n‘‘business’’ days, to request a hearing.",
  "FMS was concerned that 15 calendar\ndays would not allow sufficient time for\na debtor to request a hearing prior to the\nissuance of a garnishment order given\nthat 15 calendar days could include four\nto seven weekend days or holidays.",
  "For\nthis reason, NPRM § 285.11(f)(4) has not\nbeen changed.",
  "Several comments addressed the\nhearing procedures proposed in the\nNPRM.",
  "The final rule incorporates the\ncomment from two commenters\n\n\f25138\n\nFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.",
  "87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\nsuggesting that the requirement in\nNPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) that a debtor\nprove by ‘‘clear and convincing\nevidence’’ that no debt exists or that the\namount of the debt is incorrect is too\nburdensome.",
  "In the final rule at\n§ 285.11(f)(8)(ii), FMS replaced the\n‘‘clear and convincing’’ standard with\nthe less burdensome ‘‘preponderance of\nthe evidence’’ standard.",
  "One commenter suggested that\nproving the terms of the repayment\nschedule are ‘‘unreasonable,’’ as\nrequired at NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii), is\ntoo vague and that the debtor should be\nrequired to show that the terms of the\nrepayment schedule would cause a\n‘‘financial hardship’’ to the debtor.",
  "The\nfinal rule incorporates this suggestion.",
  "In response to a commenter’s\n\nsuggestion, NPRM § 285.11(f)(8)(ii) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the debtor\nmay present evidence that collection of\nthe debt may not be pursued due to\noperation of law, e.g., enforcement of\nthe order is subject to the automatic stay\nimposed at the time of a bankruptcy\nfiling pursuant to 11 U.S.C.",
  "362. Two commenters suggested that this\n\nrule restrict hearing officials to those\nindividuals not under the supervision or\ncontrol of the head of the agency.",
  "The\ncommenters suggested that the rule,\nwithout such a change, could result in\ninequitable wage garnishment hearing\ndecisions since an agency, and its\nqualified hearing officer, have a vested\ninterest in the outcome.",
  "FMS disagrees\nfor three reasons.",
  "First, Congress did not\nintend to require that hearing officials\nbe independent.",
  "Unlike other statutes,\nsee, e.g., 5 U.S.C.",
  "5514(a)(2) (concerning\nFederal salary offset), the DCIA does not\nrequire an independent hearing official.",
  "Second, the rule explicitly sets forth\nminimum hearing procedures that\nensure the debtor has a meaningful\nopportunity to be heard and minimize\nthe risk of erroneous deprivation of the\ndebtor’s property interest in his or her\nwages.",
  "Finally, any final hearing\ndecision by the agency on wage\ngarnishment is subject to judicial review\nunder the Administrative Procedure\nAct.",
  "See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 706 (concerning\njudicial review of an agency’s actions).",
  "NPRM § 285.11(g) Wage Garnishment\nOrder\n\nOne commenter noted that the\nprovision under NPRM § 285.11(g)\nrequiring agencies to submit a wage\ngarnishment order to a debtor’s\nemployer within 30 days of a hearing\ndecision (or within 30 days after the\ndebtor fails to make a timely request for\na hearing) should be reconciled with the\n20 day period provided under\nEducation’s wage garnishment\n\nregulation at 34 CFR 682.410(b)(10)(H).",
  "Such a reconciliation with Education’s\nrule is not warranted or necessary.",
  "The\ntime period in this rule accommodates\na broad range of agencies’ requirements\nand is consistent with the goal of\nissuing a wage garnishment order\npromptly after notice and an\nopportunity to be heard have been\nprovided to the debtor.",
  "The final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(g)(2) be amended to delete the\nrequirement that the wage garnishment\norder be signed by the head of the\nagency or his/her designee.",
  "The\ncommenter suggested that issuance of\nthe wage garnishment order on agency\nletterhead including the agency’s seal is\nsufficient to demonstrate official\nissuance.",
  "This rule requires a signature\nto authenticate a wage withholding\norder.",
  "Failure to include a signature on\na wage withholding order could result\nin employer uncertainty as to the\nvalidity of the order and could result in\ndelay, and possible loss, of garnishment\npayments to which the Government is\nentitled.",
  "As noted in the NPRM and as\nsuggested by a commenter, FMS is\ndeveloping a wage garnishment order\nform.",
  "It is anticipated that the use of a\nstandard wage garnishment order form\nby agencies will make it easier for\nprivate sector employers to recognize\nand comply with agency wage\ngarnishment order requirements.",
  "This\nform will be available from FMS at the\naddress listed above and will be\navailable for downloading from the FMS\nweb site at the following address:\nwww.fms.treas.gov.",
  "One commenter suggested that rather\n\nthan require the agency to keep a\ncertificate of service indicating the date\nof the mailing of a garnishment order,\nthe rule should require the debtor’s\nemployer to verify receipt.",
  "The\ncommenter’s rationale is that the DCIA\n(31 U.S.C.",
  "3720D(f)(2)(A)) and NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) authorize the agency to sue\nthe employer for noncompliance with\nthe wage garnishment order.",
  "The final\nrule does not incorporate this comment\nbecause the Government need only\nshow that the order was mailed, not\nwhether it actually was received.",
  "Nelson\nv. Diversified Collection Services, 961\nF.Supp. 863, 868–69 (D. Md. 1997).",
  "By\nrequiring an agency to retain a copy of\nthe certificate of service, the agency can\nproduce evidence that the order was\nmailed without having to place an\nadditional burden on the employer.",
  "One commenter suggested that the\nrequirement to comply with the wage\ngarnishment order should be waived\nunder circumstances when a small\n\nemployer (with less than five\nemployees) would be subject to a major\nhardship (financial or otherwise) as a\nresult of complying with the order.",
  "Such\na change to the rule is unnecessary since\nthe use of the wage garnishment\ncollection tool by agencies is not\nmandated under the DCIA.",
  "Agencies can\nset their own policies on when it is\nappropriate to utilize the administrative\nwage garnishment process.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(h) Certification by\nEmployer\n\nThe final rule did not incorporate the\nrecommendation of two commenters to\ndelete the requirement under NPRM\n§ 285.11(h) requiring the debtor’s\nemployer to complete and return a\ncertification form to the agency.",
  "The\ncommenters suggested this provision is\nunduly burdensome and that an\nemployer’s failure to complete and\nreturn the form could unnecessarily\ndelay the garnishment process.",
  "The\ncertification form serves multiple\npurposes.",
  "One, the form provides the\nagency with information necessary to\nmonitor the employer’s compliance\nwith the wage garnishment order in\naccordance with the requirements of the\nDCIA and applicable laws.",
  "The form\nalso will provide information so the\nagency can calculate anticipated\ncollection amounts to determine\nwhether to pursue other collection tools.",
  "Finally, the form will assist the\nemployer in calculating the amount to\nbe garnished from the debtor’s\ndisposable pay.",
  "It is noted that the\nemployer’s failure to complete the\ncertification form as required does not\naffect the employer’s responsibility to\nwithhold the appropriate garnishment\namount within a ‘‘reasonable time’’ in\naccordance with this rule.",
  "See NPRM\n§ 285.11(i)(7), renumbered as\n§ 285.11(i)(8) in the final rule.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(i) Amounts Withheld\nTwo commenters recommended\nclarifying the impact of the Consumer\nCredit Protection Act’s (CCPA)\nminimum disposable pay requirement\non the wage garnishment provisions of\nthe DCIA and this rule.",
  "See CCPA,\n§ 303(a)(2), codified at 15 U.S.C.",
  "1673(a)(2) (maximum allowable\ngarnishment).",
  "NPRM § 285.11(i) has\nbeen amended to clarify that the amount\nof garnishment is limited by the CCPA.",
  "Under section 285.11(i) of the final rule,\nthe amount of garnishment is the lesser\nof the amount indicated on the\ngarnishment order up to 15% of the\ndebtor’s disposable pay or the amount\nset forth in 15 U.S.C.",
  "1673(a)(2). The\namount set forth in 15 U.S.C.",
  "1673(a)(2)\nis the amount by which a debtor’s\n\n\fFederal  Register / Vol. 63,  No.",
  "87 / Wednesday,  May  6,  1998 / Rules  and  Regulations\n\n25139\n\ndisposable pay exceeds an amount\nequivalent to thirty times the minimum\nwage.",
  "For example, if a debtor receives\ndisposable pay of $160.00 per week and\nthirty times the minimum wage is\n$154.50, the amount that may be\ngarnished weekly is the lesser of $24.00\n(15% of $160) or $5.50 ($160.00–\n$154.40 = $5.50).",
  "See 29 CFR\n870.10(b)(1) for information on\ncalculating an amount equivalent to\nthirty times the minimum wage.",
  "Section 285.11(i)(3) of the final rule is\nthe same as NPRM § 285.11(i)(2) except\nthat § 285.11(i)(3)(iii) has been added to\nclarify the amount of garnishment for a\ndebtor who owes multiple debts to a\nsingle creditor agency.",
  "Under section\n285(i)(3)(iii) of the final rule, an agency\nmay issue multiple withholding orders\nso long as the total amount garnished\nfrom the debtor’s pay for such orders\ndoes not exceed the garnishment\namount permitted under § 285.11(i)(2).",
  "For purposes of § 285.11(i)(3)(iii), the\nterm ‘‘agency’’ refers to the agency that\nis owed the debt.",
  "One commenter suggested deleting\n\nthe language in NPRM § 285.11(i)(7)\n(renumbered as § 285.11(i)(8) in the\nfinal rule) requiring that the wage\ngarnishment order ‘‘indicate a\nreasonable period of time within which\nthe employer is required to commence\nwage withholding’’ because\ngarnishment orders in all other contexts\ntypically require immediate compliance.",
  "This suggestion was not incorporated\ninto the final rule.",
  "The ‘‘reasonable\nperiod of time’’ given to employers\nallows employers adequate time to\ncalculate garnishment withholding\npayroll data involving a debtor\nemployee without disrupting the normal\npayroll cycle.",
  "It is anticipated that a\n‘‘reasonable period of time’’ generally\nwill mean that the employer will\ncommence withholdings within two pay\ncycles following receipt of the\ngarnishment order.",
  "This may vary given\nan employer’s circumstances.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(j) Exclusions From\nGarnishment.",
  "No changes were made to the NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(n).",
  "FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(k) Financial Hardship\nThe final rule does not incorporate\none commenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(k) be amended further to define\nthe standards for agency review of a\ndebtor’s request for an adjustment in the\namount withheld under a wage\ngarnishment order due to ‘‘financial\nhardship’’ based on ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances.’’ NPRM § 285.11(k),\nunchanged in the final rule, provides\n\nillustrative examples of the type of\nevents which may give rise to financial\nhardship due to ‘‘materially changed\ncircumstances,’’ such as disability,\ndivorce, or catastrophic illness.",
  "However, whether financial hardship\nexists must be determined by an\nagency’s review of the particular facts\nand circumstances of a given case.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(l) Ending Garnishment\nThe final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that the rule\nclarify whether collection costs need to\nbe collected before terminating the\ngarnishment action.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(l),\nunchanged in the final rule, clearly\nrequires termination of garnishment\nonly after the agency ‘‘has fully\nrecovered the amounts owed by the\ndebtor, including interest, penalties and\nadministrative costs consistent with the\nFCCS (Federal Claims Collection\nStandards).’’ See 31 U.S.C.",
  "3717(e) and\n4 CFR 102.13 regarding the collection of\nadministrative costs associated with a\ndebt.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(m) Actions Prohibited\nby the Employer\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(m).",
  "FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(n) Refunds\n\nNo changes were made to NPRM\n§ 285.11(n).",
  "FMS did not receive any\ncomments applicable to this paragraph.",
  "NPRM § 285.11(o) Right of Action.",
  "The final rule does not incorporate a\n\ncommenter’s suggestion that NPRM\n§ 285.11(o) be amended to remove the\nrequirement that a Federal agency must\n‘‘terminate collection action’’ as a\nprerequisite to commencing suit against\na debtor’s employer for failure to\nwithhold amounts from wages pursuant\nto a wage garnishment order.",
  "The DCIA\nspecifically provides that ‘‘suit (against\nan employer) may not be filed before the\ntermination of the collection action,\nunless earlier filing is necessary to avoid\nexpiration of any applicable statute of\nlimitations period.’’ 31 U.S.C. 3720D(f)(2)(B).",
  "However, FMS has amended NPRM\n\n§ 285.11(o) in the final rule to\nincorporate a suggestion by another\ncommenter that the rule be changed to\nclarify that ‘‘termination of the\ncollection action’’ merely refers to the\nparticular debtor/employee, rather than\nthe debt.",

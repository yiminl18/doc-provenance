The westerlies ( blue arrows ) and trade winds ( yellow and brown arrows ) <P> The trade winds are the prevailing pattern of easterly surface winds found in the tropics , within the lower portion of the Earth 's atmosphere , in the lower section of the troposphere near the Earth 's equator . The trade winds blow predominantly from the northeast in the Northern Hemisphere and from the southeast in the Southern Hemisphere , strengthening during the winter and when the Arctic oscillation is in its warm phase . Trade winds have been used by captains of sailing ships to cross the world 's oceans for centuries , and enabled European empire expansion into the Americas and trade routes to become established across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans . </P> <P> In meteorology , the trade winds act as the steering flow for tropical storms that form over the Atlantic , Pacific , and southern Indian Oceans and make landfall in North America , Southeast Asia , and Madagascar and eastern Africa , respectively . Trade winds also transport African dust westward across the Atlantic Ocean into the Caribbean Sea , as well as portions of southeastern North America . Shallow cumulus clouds are seen within trade wind regimes , and are capped from becoming taller by a trade wind inversion , which is caused by descending air aloft from within the subtropical ridge . The weaker the trade winds become , the more rainfall can be expected in the neighboring landmasses . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 Cause </Li> <Li> 3 Weather effects </Li> <Li> 4 See also </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> A Spanish galleon See also : Age of Discovery , Volta do Mar , and Age of sail <P> The term trade winds originally derives from the early fourteenth century late Middle Engli...",

It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the 1895 will of Alfred Nobel ( who died in 1896 ) , awarded for outstanding contributions in physics . As dictated by Nobel 's will , the award is administered by the Nobel Foundation and awarded by a committee that consists of five members elected by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences . The award is presented in Stockholm at an annual ceremony on December 10 , the anniversary of Nobel 's death .

John Bardeen is the only laureate to win the prize twice -- in 1956 and 1972 . Maria Skłodowska - Curie also won two Nobel Prizes , for physics in 1903 and chemistry in 1911 . William Lawrence Bragg was , until October 2014 , the youngest ever Nobel laureate ; he won the prize in 1915 at the age of 25 . Two women have won the prize : Curie and Maria Goeppert - Mayer ( 1963 ) . As of 2017 , the prize has been awarded to 206 individuals . There have been six years in which the Nobel Prize in Physics was not awarded ( 1916 , 1931 , 1934 , 1940 -- 1942 ) . </P>...",

Additionally , there are numerous seedless citrus fruits , such as oranges , lemons and limes . </P> <P> The term `` seedless fruit '' is biologically somewhat contradictory , since fruits are usually defined botanically as mature ovaries containing seeds . </P> <P> Seedless fruits can develop in one of two ways : either the fruit develops without fertilization ( parthenocarpy ) , or pollination triggers fruit development , but the ovules or embryos abort without producing mature seeds ( stenospermocarpy ) . Seedless banana and watermelon fruits are produced on triploid plants , whose three sets of chromosomes make it very unlikely for meiosis to produce fertile gametes . This is because one of the three copies of each chromosome ca n't pair with another appropriate chromosome before separating into daughter cells , so these extra third copies end up randomly distributed between the two daughter cells from meiosis 1 , resulting in the ( usually ) swiftly lethal aneuploidy condition . Such plants can arise by spontaneous mutation or by hybridization between diploid and tetraploid individuals of the same or different species .

      "context": "Game seven - wikipedia <H1> Game seven </H1> Jump to : navigation , search `` Game 7 '' redirects here . For the song by T.I. , see We Want Smoke . <P> A game seven is the final game of a best of seven series . This game can occur in the postseasons for Major League Baseball ( MLB ) ( League Championship Series and World Series ) , the National Basketball Association ( NBA ) ( all rounds of the NBA playoffs ) , and the National Hockey League ( NHL ) ( all rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs ) . </P> <P> The game is generally played at the site of the team holding the home advantage across the series . </P> <P> The nature of a best - of - seven series requires that the series be tied at three games apiece going into game seven , such that either team can take the series ( advancing further in the playoffs or winning the championship ) by winning the game . Because of this decisive nature , game sevens add an element of drama to their sports . </P> <P> Aside from North American sports leagues , game sevens are also a fixture in many other sports around the world , mostly in baseball , basketball , and ice hockey leagues . Most codes of football do not employ a best - of - seven series ( or any best - of - x series in general ) , hence game sevens are not played in those leagues . </P> <P> Some playoff rounds ( such as MLB 's current Division Series ) are played in a best of five format , such that game five has similar qualities to those described above , though the suspense and drama have less time to build in a shorter series . Furthermore , the World Series of 1903 , 1919 , 1920 , and 1921 were played in a best of nine format , though none of the four went to a decisive game nine . </P> <P> The game seven is comparable to a final or to a single game in a single - elimination tournament or to a one - game playoff . The game is equivalent to the Super Bowl game in the National Football League in that the game 's winner is the league 's champion for the season . </P> <...",

It was first announced to Congress by President Harry S. Truman on March 12 , 1947 and further developed on July 12 , 1948 when he pledged to contain threats to Greece and Turkey . Direct American military force was usually not involved , but Congress appropriated financial aid to support the economies and militaries of Greece and Turkey . More generally , the Truman Doctrine implied American support for other nations allegedly threatened by Soviet communism .

'' Truman claims that because totalitarian regimes coerced free peoples , they automatically represented a threat to international peace and the national security of the United States . Truman made the plea in the midst of the Greek Civil War ( 1946 -- 49 ) . He argued that if Greece and Turkey did not receive the aid , they would inevitably fall to communism with grave consequences throughout the region . Because Turkey and Greece were historic rivals , it was considered necessary to help both equally even though the crisis in Greece was far more intense . </P> <P> Critics of the policy have observed that the governments of Greece and Turkey were themselves far from democratic at this time , and neither were facing Soviet subversion in the spring of 1949 .

      "question": "where in the constitution is the concept of federalism established",
      "answer": "<P> Because the states were preexisting political entities , the U.S. Constitution did not need to define or explain federalism in any one section but it often mentions the rights and responsibilities of state governments and state officials in relation to the federal government . The federal government has certain express powers ( also called enumerated powers ) which are powers spelled out in the Constitution , including the right to levy taxes , declare war , and regulate interstate and foreign commerce . In addition , the Necessary and Proper Clause gives the federal government the implied power to pass any law `` necessary and proper '' for the execution of its express powers . Other powers -- the reserved powers -- are reserved to the people or the states . The power delegated to the federal government was significantly expanded by the Supreme Court decision in McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) , amendments to the Constitution following the Civil War , and by some later amendments -- as well as the overall claim of the Civil War , that the states were legally subject to the final dictates of the federal government . </P>",

Complex , image - forming eyes have evolved independently several times . The evolutionary geneticist Walter Gering holds a different opinion . According his theory , the genes engaged with photoreceptor cells ( so called Pax 6 genes ) appeared probably at once in the life history , at a very early stage of the evolution .

From before the Cambrian , no evidence of eyes has survived , but diverse eyes are known from the Burgess shale of the Middle Cambrian , and from the slightly older Emu Bay Shale .

They are used primarily as a flavouring and stability agent in beer , to which they impart bitter , zesty , or citric flavours ; though they are also used for various purposes in other beverages and herbal medicine . The hop plant is a vigorous , climbing , herbaceous perennial , usually trained to grow up strings in a field called a hopfield , hop garden ( nomenclature in the South of England ) , or hop yard ( in the West Country and U.S. ) when grown commercially . Many different varieties of hops are grown by farmers around the world , with different types used for particular styles of beer . </P> <P> The first documented use of hops in beer is from the 9th century , though Hildegard of Bingen , 300 years later , is often cited as the earliest documented source . Before this period , brewers used a `` gruit '' , composed of a wide variety of bitter herbs and flowers , including dandelion , burdock root , marigold , horehound ( the old German name for horehound , Berghopfen , means `` mountain hops '' ) , ground ivy , and heather .

She inevitably becomes PTA president after embarrassing Flora , the snobby former President and her equally snobby friends . </Li> <Li> Ronny Cox as Willis `` Will '' Newton , a wealthy member of the PTA who does n't agree with Flora and her snobby allies and is in love with Stella . He and Stella get married at the end of the movie . </Li> <Li> Nanette Fabray as Alice Finley , Stella 's best friend and co-conspirator against the snobs of Harper Valley . She owns and operates the La Moderne Beauty Shop . </Li> <Li> Louis Nye as Kirby Baker , a local real estate agent who is allied with Flora and her friends . Notorious for being a lecherous playboy and infamous for impregnating his secretaries , one of whom , Gladys Wilmot , left town to see an abortionist in Cincinnati . As part of a plan to discredit Stella , he tries to foreclose on Stella 's house , which infuriates her . He then gets arrested and jailed for attacking Myrna Wong , a friend of Stella 's , who rebuffs his advances , throwing him by use of martial arts and destroying the office . </Li> <Li> John Fiedler as Bobby Taylor , a man on the PTA who lusts after Stella . Overly dominated by his wife , Holly . Although open to allow Stella to speak , he is not above having a fellow PTA board member kidnapped to commit election fraud . He was arrested for indecent exposure after being set up by Stella . </Li> <Li> Ron Masak as Herbie Maddox , the head bartender at Kelly 's bar , and Stella 's ally against Flora and her friends . He has a crush on Stella , and is one of her friends . </Li> <Li> Clint Howard as Corley , a young delivery person , who works for the local florist shop , who brings Stella flowers from Will . </Li> <Li> Susan Swift as Dee Johnson , Stella 's 14 - year - old daughter , who is threatened with expulsion from school if her mother does n't conform to the way the PTA wants her to behave . She has a hand in assisting her mother and Alice with one of their revenge schemes . She loses her braces , gets a makeover , and ends up with a boyfriend , Carlyle . </Li> <Li> Pat Paulsen as Otis Harper , the descendant of the founding family of Harper Valley . A PTA member who is allied with Flora and her friends . Has a tendency to drink all the time , which annoys his wife , Bertha . He had a stampede of elephants , painted pink , stormed through his house , destroying it . </Li> <Li> Amzie Strickland as Shirley Thompson , a member of the PTA board who tends to drink a lot of gin . Though she is allied with Flora and her friends , she is one of four PTA members ( Will , Skeeter and Holly Taylor are the others ) who are spared any retribution from Stella . She was seen as the most sympathetic of the board , as she tended to be more manipulated as opposed to being manipulative . It was never revealed whether or not she retained her seat on the PTA , but it is presumed that she became more sympathetic towards Stella as she was seen waving goodbye at Olive as she was being arrested . </Li> <Li> Bob Hastings as Skeeter Duggan , a member of the PTA board , and the town 's Notary public who is sympathetic to Stella . He is kidnapped by Dutch and Tex at Flora Simpson Reilly 's orders . </Li> <Li> Audrey Christie as Flora Simpson - Reilly , The movie 's main antagonist . She is the pompous and extremely snobbish president of the PTA board who thoroughly despises Stella ( who defeats her for president at the end of the movie ) and all she stands for . So desperate is she to retain her power and prestige in the community that she has a fellow member of the PTA ( Skeeter Duggan ) kidnapped so she and her allies can commit election fraud . She is embarrassed when her permanent set is destroyed by a hair depilatory at the beauty salon . </Li> <Li> Molly Dodd as Olive Glover , the recording secretary of the PTA who is a gambling addict . Clearly the most corrupt and most vindictive member of the PTA board , she is eventually arrested for embezzlement after having a load of hay and horse manure dumped on top of her . She is the one who initially angers Stella by sending her the letter denouncing her , and tries to get Dee 's friend , Mavis , arrested for embezzlement . </Li> <Li> Fay DeWitt as Willamae Jones , a snide biology teacher at the junior high school who is also a member of the PTA . She makes no secret of the fact that she favors the Reilly twins , due to the connections between her and Flora . Notorious for being a nymphomaniac ( though she hides it under a prim - and - proper façade ) , she is caught in flagrante delicto with Barney Crunk , the town 's mailman , on film . </Li> <Li> DeVera Marcus as Holly Taylor , Bobby 's obviously overbearing wife , who tends to drink a lot when Bobby is out of town , and does n't approve of Bobby 's lusting , or of anything else he does ( this is different from the character in the song , who `` seems to use a lot of ice whenever ( her husband ) 's away '' , implying adultery with the iceman ) . However , despite her ties to Flora and her scheming friends , she , like Shirley Thompson , is spared any retribution from Stella , due to Stella refusing to date Bobby . </Li> <Li> Louise Foley as Mavis , Dee Johnson 's best friend , who is nearly framed for a crime she did not commit by the vindictive Olive Glover . </Li> <Li> Brian Cook as Carlyle , a popular track star who chooses Dee , after she gets a makeover , and angers Bettina Reilly in the process . </Li> <Li> Laura Teige as Bettina Reilly , One of Flora 's twin granddaughters , who wants to be with Carlyle , and is jealous when he chooses Dee over her . She tends to be as snotty as her grandmother . </Li> <Li> Jan Teige as Edwina Reilly , Bettina 's twin sister , who is just as snotty as her . </Li> <Li> Irene Yah - Ling Sun as Myrna Wong , a friend of Stella 's who is a judo expert ; she is assaulted by Kirby Baker ( after leading him on ; she destroys him and his office in retaliation ) and has him sent to jail for assault . </Li> <Li> Tobias Anderson as `` Cranky '' Barney Crunk , the town 's nosy mailman who had the bad habit of peeking in everyone 's mail . He is caught in flagrante delicto on film with Willamae Jones . </Li> <Li> Royce D.

The primary components of vascular tissue are the xylem and phloem . These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally . There are also two meristems associated with vascular tissue : the vascular cambium and the cork cambium . All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the vascular tissue system of that plant . </P> <P> The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender . Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water , minerals , and nutrients throughout the plant , it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes .

The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue , maintaining its connection throughout the plant . The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long , discrete strands called vascular bundles . These bundles include both xylem and phloem , as well as supporting and protective cells .

The American actor Edwin Booth as Hamlet , ca . 1870 <P> The Tragedy of Hamlet , Prince of Denmark , often shortened to Hamlet ( / ˈhæmlɪt / ) , is a tragedy written by William Shakespeare at an uncertain date between 1599 and 1602 . Set in Denmark , the play dramatises the revenge Prince Hamlet is called to wreak upon his uncle , Claudius , by the ghost of Hamlet 's father , King Hamlet . Claudius had murdered his own brother and seized the throne , also marrying his deceased brother 's widow . </P> <P> Hamlet is Shakespeare 's longest play , and is considered among the most powerful and influential works of world literature , with a story capable of `` seemingly endless retelling and adaptation by others '' . It was probably one of Shakespeare 's most popular works during his lifetime , and still ranks among his most performed , topping the performance list of the Royal Shakespeare Company and its predecessors in Stratford - upon - Avon since 1879 . It has inspired many other writers -- from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe and Charles Dickens to James Joyce and Iris Murdoch -- and has been described as `` the world 's most filmed story after Cinderella '' . </P> <P> The story of Shakespeare 's Hamlet was derived from the legend of Amleth , preserved by 13th - century chronicler Saxo Grammaticus in his Gesta Danorum , as subsequently retold by the 16th - century scholar François de Belleforest .

He almost certainly wrote his version of the title role for his fellow actor , Richard Burbage , the leading tragedian of Shakespeare 's time . In the 400 years since its inception , the ro...",

Work on the symphony occupied an exceptionally productive period of just a few weeks during which time he also completed the 39th and 41st symphonies ( 26 June and 10 August , respectively ) . Nikolaus Harnoncourt conjectured that Mozart composed the three symphonies as a unified work , pointing , among other things , to the fact that the Symphony No. 40 , as the middle work , has no introduction ( unlike No. 39 ) and does not have a finale of the scale of No. 41 's . </P> <P> The 40th symphony exists in two versions , differing primarily in that one includes parts for a pair of clarinets ( with suitable adjustments made in the other wind parts ) .

It uses interchangeable pre-formed type elements , each with typically 96 glyphs , to generate high - quality output comparable to premium typewriters such as the IBM Selectric , but two to three times faster .

This was carried through the Five - Year Plans , developed , executed , and monitored by the Planning Commission ( 1951 - 2014 ) and the NITI Aayog ( 2015 - 2017 ) . With the prime minister as the ex-officio chairman , the commission has a nominated deputy chairman , who holds the rank of a cabinet Minister . Montek Singh Ahluwalia is the last deputy chairman of the commission ( resigned on 26 May 2014 ) . The Twelfth Plan completed its term in March 2017 . Prior to the Fourth Plan , the allocation of state resources was based on schematic patterns rather than a transparent and objective mechanism , which led to the adoption of the Gadgil formula in 1969 . Revised versions of the formula have been used since then to determine the allocation of central assistance for state plans . The new government led by Narendra Modi , elected in 2014 , has announced the dissolution of the Planning Commission , and its replacement by a think tank called the NITI Aayog ( an acronym for National Institution for Transforming India ) . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 History </Li> <Li> 2 First Plan ( 1951 -- 1956 ) </Li> <Li> 3 Second Plan ( 1956 -- 1961 ) </Li> <Li> 4 Third Plan ( 1961 -- 1966 ) </Li> <Li> 5 Fourth Plan ( 1969 -- 1974 ) </Li> <Li> 6 Fifth Plan ( 1974 -- 1978 ) </Li> <Li> 7 Rolling Plan ( 1978 -- 1980 ) </Li> <Li> 8 Sixth Plan ( 1980 -- 1985 ) </Li> <Li> 9 Seventh Plan ( 1985 -- 1990 ) </Li> <Li> 10 Annual Plans ( 1990 -- 1992 ) </Li> <Li> 11 Eighth Plan ( 1992 -- 1997 ) </Li> <Li> 12 Ninth Plan ( 1997 -- 2002 ) </Li> <Li> 13 Tenth Plan ( 2002 -- 2007 ) </Li> <Li> 14 Eleventh Plan ( 2007 -- 2012 ) </Li> <Li> 15 Twelfth Plan ( 2012 -- 2017 ) </Li> <Li> 16 See also </Li> <Li> 17 References </Li> <Li> 18 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> <P> Five -...",

On October 7 , 1988 , he underwent surgery , which removed half of the deltoid muscle in his pitching arm and froze the humerus bone in an effort to eliminate all of the cancerous cells . Doctors advised Dravecky to wait until 1990 to pitch again , but Dravecky was determined to pitch in 1989 . By July 1989 , he was pitching in the minors , and on August 10 , he made a highly publicized return to the major leagues , pitching eight innings and defeating Cincinnati 4 -- 3 . In his following start , five days later in Montreal , Dravecky pitched three no - hit innings , but in the fifth inning , he felt a tingling sensation in his arm . In the sixth inning , he started off shaky , allowing a home run to the leadoff batter and then hitting the second batter , Andrés Galarraga . Then , on his first pitch to Tim Raines , his humerus bone snapped ; the sound of it breaking could be heard throughout the stadium . Dravecky collapsed on the mound .

The modern Santa Claus grew out of traditions surrounding the historical Saint Nicholas ( a fourth - century Greek bishop and gift - giver of Myra ) , the British figure of Father Christmas and the Dutch figure of Sinterklaas ( himself also based on Saint Nicholas ) . Some maintain Santa Claus also absorbed elements of the Germanic god Wodan , who was associated with the pagan midwinter event of Yule and led the Wild Hunt , a ghostly procession through the sky . </P> <P> Santa Claus is generally depicted as a portly , joyous , white - bearded man -- sometimes with spectacles -- wearing a red coat with white fur collar and cuffs , white - fur - cuffed red trousers , a red hat with white fur and black leather belt and boots and who carries a bag full of gifts for children . This image became popular in the United States and Canada in the 19th century due to the significant influence of the 1823 poem `` A Visit from St. Nicholas '' and of caricaturist and political cartoonist Thomas Nast .

Its surface and shores are 430.5 metres ( 1,412 ft ) below sea level , Earth 's lowest elevation on land . The Dead Sea is 304 m ( 997 ft ) deep , the deepest hypersaline lake in the world . With a salinity of 342 g / kg , or 34.2 % , ( in 2011 ) , it is 9.6 times as salty as the ocean and one of the world 's saltiest bodies of water . This salinity makes for a harsh environment in which plants and animals can not flourish , hence its name .

The brain is located in the head , usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision . The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate 's body . In a human , the cerebral cortex contains approximately 15 -- 33 billion neurons , each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons . These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons , which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells . </P> <P> Physiologically , the function of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body . The brain acts on the rest of the body both by generating patterns of muscle activity and by driving the secretion of chemicals called hormones . This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses to changes in the environment . Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia , but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilit...",

These immigrants began to settle various regions of North America west of the Great Plains as part of the mass overland migrations of the mid-19th century . Settlers emigrating from the eastern United States were spurred by various motives , among them religious persecution , economic incentives , and the prospect of new wealth and new freedoms in what was then a largely unspoiled and unregulated country . By the 1840s , several popular and well - established routes had been blazed through the continental interior to destinations in the far west , including the Oregon Trail , California Trail , and Mormon Trail . After the end of the Mexican -- American War in 1849 , vast new American conquests again enticed mass immigration . Legislation like the Donation Land Claim Act and significant events like the California Gold Rush further lured colonists to travel overland to the west . </P> <P> Two major wagon - based transportation networks , one typically starting in Missouri and the other in the Mexican province of Santa Fe de Nuevo México , served the majority of migrants during the era of westward expansion . Three of the Missouri - based routes -- the Oregon , Mormon , and California Trails -- were collectively known as the Emigrant Trails . Historians have estimated at least 500,000 emigrants used these three trails between 1843 and 1869 , and d...",

The first period usually begins between twelve and fifteen years of age , a point in time known as menarche . However , periods may occasionally start as young as eight years old and still be considered normal .

      "context": "American entry into World war I - wikipedia <H1> American entry into World war I </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> The American entry into World War I came in April 1917 , after more than two and a half years of efforts by President Woodrow Wilson to keep the United States out of the war . Apart from an Anglophile element urging early support for the British , American public opinion reflected that of the president : the sentiment for neutrality was particularly strong among Irish Americans , German Americans and Scandinavian Americans , as well as among church leaders and among women in general . On the other hand , even before World War I had broken out , American opinion had been more negative toward Germany than towards any other country in Europe . Over time , especially after reports of atrocities in Belgium in 1914 and following the sinking of the passenger liner RMS Lusitania in 1915 , the American people increasingly came to see Germany as the aggressor in Europe . </P> <P> As U.S. president , it was Wilson who made the key policy decisions over foreign affairs : while the country was at peace , the domestic economy ran on a laissez - faire basis , with American banks making huge loans to Britain and France -- funds that were in large part used to buy munitions , raw materials , and food from across the Atlantic . Until 1917 , Wilson made minimal preparations for a land war and kept the United States Army on a small peacetime footing , despite increasing demands for enhanced preparedness . He did however expand the United States Navy . </P> <P> In 1917 , with Russia experiencing political upheaval following widespread disillusionment there over the war , and with Britain and France low on credit , Germany appeared to have the upper hand in Europe , while Germany 's ally , the Ottoman Empire , clung stubbornly to its possessions in the Middle East . In the same year , Germany decided to resume unrestricted submarine warfare against any vessel approachi...",

In a stock corporation , non-executive directors are voted for by the shareholders and the board is the highest authority in the management of the corporation . The board of directors appoints the chief executive officer of the corporation and sets out the overall strategic direction . In corporations with dispersed ownership , the identification and nomination of directors ( that shareholders vote for or against ) are often done by the board itself , leading to a high degree of self - perpetuation . In a non-stock corporation with no general voting membership , the board is the supreme governing body of the institution ; its members are sometimes chosen by the board itself . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Terminology </Li> <Li> 2 Roles </Li> <Li> 3 Directors <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Inside director </Li> <Li> 3.2 Outside director </Li> <Li> 3.3 Terminology </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Process and structure <Ul>...",

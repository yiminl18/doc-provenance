      "context": "Colony ( Biology ) - wikipedia <H1> Colony ( Biology ) </H1> Jump to : navigation , search <P> In biology , a colony is composed of two or more conspecific individuals living in close association with , or connected to , one another . This association is usually for mutual benefit such as stronger defense or the ability to attack bigger prey . It is a cluster of identical cells ( clones ) on the surface of ( or within ) a solid medium , usually derived from a single parent cell , as in bacterial colony . In contrast , a solitary organism is one in which all individuals live independently and have all of the functions needed to survive and reproduce . </P> <P> Colonies , in the context of development , may be composed of two or more unitary ( or solitary ) organisms or be modular organisms . Unitary organisms have determinate development ( set life stages ) from zygote to adult form and individuals or groups of individuals ( colonies ) are visually distinct . Modular organisms have indeterminate growth forms ( life stages not set ) through repeated iteration of genetically identical modules ( or individuals ) , and it can be difficult to distinguish between the colony as a whole and the modules within . In the latter case , modules may have specific functions within the colony . </P> <P> Some organisms are primarily independent and form facultative colonies in reply to environmental conditions while others must live in a colony to survive ( obligate ) . For example , some carpenter bees will form colonies when a dominant hierarchy is formed between two or more nest foundresses ( facultative colony ) , while corals are animals that are physically connected by living tissue ( the coenosarc ) that contains a shared gastrovascular cavity . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Colony types <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Social colonies </Li> <Li> 1.2 Modular organisms </Li> <Li> 1.3 Microbial colonies </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Life history </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li>...",

Robotically - assisted surgery was developed to overcome the limitations of pre-existing minimally - invasive surgical procedures and to enhance the capabilities of surgeons performing open surgery . </P> <P> In the case of robotically - assisted minimally - invasive surgery , instead of directly moving the instruments , the surgeon uses one of two methods to control the instruments ; either a direct telemanipulator or through computer control . A telemanipulator is a remote manipulator that allows the surgeon to perform the normal movements associated with the surgery whilst the robotic arms carry out those movements using end - effectors and manipulators to perform the actual surgery on the patient . In computer - controlled systems the surgeon uses a computer to control the robotic arms and its end - effectors , though these systems can also still use telemanipulators for their input . One advantage of using the computerised method is that the surgeon does not have to be present , but can be anywhere in the world , leading to the possibility for remote surgery . </P> <P> In the case of enhanced open surgery , autonomous instruments ( in familiar configurations ) replace traditional steel tools , performing cer...",

There is no standard temperature . Its symbol is Δ H. The superscript Plimsoll on this symbol indicates that the process has occurred under standard conditions at the specified temperature ( usually 25 ° C or 298.15 K ) .

      "context": "Income elasticity of demand - wikipedia <H1> Income elasticity of demand </H1> <P> In economics , income elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of the quantity demanded for a good or service to a change in the income of the people demanding the good . It is calculated as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity demanded to the percentage change in income . For example , if in response to a 10 % increase in income , the quantity demanded for a good increased by 20 % , the income elasticity of demand would be 20 % / 10 % = 2.0 </P> <H2> Contents </H2> <Ul> <Li> 1 Interpretation </Li> <Li> 2 Mathematical definition </Li> <Li> 3 Types of income elasticity of demand </Li> <Li> 4 Selected income elasticities </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 Notes </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> </Ul> <H2> Interpretation ( edit ) </H2> Inferior goods ' demand falls as consumer income increases . <Ul> <Li> A negative income elasticity of demand is associated with inferior goods ; an increase in income will lead to a fall in the demand and may lead to changes to more luxurious substitutes . </Li> <Li> A positive income elasticity of demand is associated with normal goods ; an increase in income will lead to a rise in demand .

      "context": "Urban heat island - wikipedia <H1> Urban heat island </H1> Tokyo , an example of an urban heat island . Normal temperatures of Tokyo go up more than those of the surrounding area . <P> An urban heat island ( UHI ) is an urban area or metropolitan area that is significantly warmer than its surrounding rural areas due to human activities . The temperature difference usually is larger at night than during the day , and is most apparent when winds are weak . UHI is most noticeable during the summer and winter . The main cause of the urban heat island effect is from the modification of land surfaces . Waste heat generated by energy usage is a secondary contributor . As a population center grows , it tends to expand its area and increase its average temperature . The less - used term heat island refers to any area , populated or not , which is consistently hotter than the surrounding area . </P> <P> Monthly rainfall is greater downwind of cities , partially due to the UHI . Increases in heat within urban centers increases the length of growing seasons , and decreases the occurrence of weak tornadoes . The UHI decreases air quality by increasing the production of pollutants such as ozone , and decreases water quality as warmer waters flow into area streams and put stress on their ecosystems . </P> <P> Not all cities have a distinct urban heat island . Mitigation of the urban heat island effect can be accomplished through the use of green roofs and the use of lighter - colored surfaces in urban areas , which reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat . </P> <P> There are concerns raised about possible contribution from urban heat islands to global warming . Research on China indicates that urban heat island effect contributes to climate warming by about 30 % . On the other hand , one 1999 comparison between urban and rural areas proposed that the urban heat island effects have little influence on global mean temperature trends .

Artemia , the only genus in the family Artemiidae , has changed little externally since the Triassic period . The first historical record of the existence of Artemia dates back to the first half of the 10th century AD from Urmia Lake , Iran , with an example called by an Iranian geographer an `` aquatic dog '' , although the first unambiguous record is the report and drawings made by Schlösser in 1757 of animals from Lymington , England . Artemia populations are found worldwide in inland saltwater lakes , but not in oceans .

Hydrothermal vents exist because the earth is both geologically active and has large amounts of water on its surface and within its crust . Common land types include hot springs , fumaroles and geysers . Under the sea , hydrothermal vents may form features called black smokers . Relative to the majority of the deep sea , the areas around submarine hydrothermal vents are biologically more productive , often hosting complex communities fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids . Chemosynthetic bacteria and archaea form the base of the food chain , supporting diverse organisms , including giant tube worms , clams , limpets and shrimp .

Texture is often described in regard to the density , or thickness , and range , or width , between lowest and highest pitches , in relative terms as well as more specifically distinguished according to the number of voices , or parts , and the relationship between these voices ( see Common types below ) . For example , a thick texture contains many ' layers ' of instruments . One of these layers could be a string section , or another brass . The thickness also is changed by the amount and the richness of the instruments playing the piece . The thickness varies from light to thick . A piece 's texture may be changed by the number and character of parts playing at once , the timbre of the instruments or voices playing these parts and the harmony , tempo , and rhythms used ( Benward & Saker 2003 , ) . The types categorized by number and relationship of parts are analyzed and determined through the labeling of primary textural elements : primary melody ( PM ) , secondary melody ( SM ) , parallel supporting melody ( PSM ) , static support ( SS ) , harmonic support ( HS ) , rhythmic support ( RS ) , and harmonic and rhythmic support ( HRS ) ( Isaac & Russell 2003 , p. 136 ) . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Common types </Li> <Li> 2 Additional types </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 Further reading </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Common types ( edit ) </H2> <P> In musical terms , particularly in the fields of music history and music analysis , some common terms for different ty...",

Some versions state a moral at the end along the lines of `` Idleness brings want '' , `` To work today is to eat tomorrow '' , `` Beware of winter before it comes '' . In La Fontaine 's Fables no final judgment is made , although it has been argued that the author is there making sly fun of his own notoriously improvident ways . But the point of view in most retellings of the fable is supportive of the ant . It is also influenced by the commendation in the biblical Book of Proverbs , which mentions the ant twice . The first proverb admonishes , `` Go to the ant , you sluggard ! Consider her ways and be wise , which having no captain , overseer or ruler , provides her supplies in the summer , and gathers her food in the harvest '' ( 6.6 - 9 ) . Later , in a parallel saying of Agur , the insects figure among the ' four things that are little upon the earth but they are exceeding wise . The ants are a people not strong , yet they provide their food in the summer . ' ( 30.24 - 5 ) </P>",

They were ultimately responsible for overseeing all government activity in the 250 districts that comprised British India . They were appointed under Section XXXII of the Government of India Act 1858 , enacted by the Parliament of the United Kingdom . The ICS was headed by the Secretary of State for India , a member of the British cabinet . </P> <P> At first almost all the top thousand members of the ICS , known as `` Civilians '' , were British , and had been educated in the best British schools . By 1905 , five per cent were from Bengal . In 1947 there were 322 Indians and 688 British members ; most of the latter left at the time of partition and independence . </P> <P> Until the 1930s the Indians in the service were very few and were not given high posts by the British . Wainwright notes that by the mid-1880s , `` the basis of racial discrimination in the sub-continent had solidified '' . </P> <P> At the time of the birth of India and Pakistan in 1947 , the outgoing Government of India 's ICS was divided between India and Pakistan . Although these are now organised differently , the contemporary Civil Services of India , the Central Superior Services of Pakistan , Bangladesh Civil Service and Myanmar Civil Service are all descended from the old Indian Civil Service . </P> <P> Historians often rate the ICS , together with the railway system , the legal system , and the Indian Army , as among the most important legacies of British rule in India . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul>...",

It was during this time that the early chordates developed the skull and the vertebral column , leading to the first craniates and vertebrates . The first fish lineages belong to the Agnatha , or jawless fish . Early examples include Haikouichthys . During the late Cambrian , eel - like jawless fish called the conodonts , and small mostly armoured fish known as ostracoderms , first appeared . Most jawless fish are now extinct ; but the extant lampreys may approximate ancient pre-jawed fish . Lampreys belong to the Cyclostomata , which includes the extant hagfish , and this group may have split early on from other agnathans . </P> <P> The first jawed vertebrates probably developed during the late Ordovician period .

At the end of 2014 , the Trust Fund contained ( or alternatively , was owed ) $2.79 trillion , up $25 billion from 2013 . The Trust Fund is required by law to be invested in non-marketable securities issued and guaranteed by the `` full faith and credit '' of the federal government .

This concept takes place in everyday interactions , and often goes unnoticed by both the person enacting the mirroring behaviors as well as the individual who is being mirrored . The activation of mirror neurons takes place within the individual who begins to mirror another 's movements , and allows them a greater connection and understanding with the individual who they are mirroring , as well as allowing the individual who is being mirrored to feel a stronger connection with the other individual .

      "answer": "<Li> 2008 : In May Google announces that it was testing face - blurring technology on its photos of the busy streets of Manhattan . The technology uses a computer algorithm to search Google 's image database for faces and blurs them . Street View integrated into Google Earth 4.3 , the Maps application on the Apple iPhone , and the Maps application for S60 3rd Edition .

        "There are studies on tools supporting greener mobility\npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none\nof them details and discusses the model underlying the\ncomputation.",
        "This paper aims at contributing to the body of\nknowledge about how people reason in practice about this type\nof data.",
        "2 Method and Settings\n\nIn order to study how people understand and accept figures of\nCOz emissions and costs due to commuting, a diary study has\nbeen conducted.",
        "We have chosen this methodology as it is\ndifficult to gather information on commuting practices through\nobservation over a long period of time.",
        "The ages varied from 27 to 56.",
        "The first\none was a face-to-face semi-directed interview with the\nparticipants where they described precisely their commuting\npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing\na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that\nthey may have for one or another means of transport and the\nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives\nfor commuting.",
        "After the 20 days, the\nparticipants returned their diaries and we were then able to\ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and COz emissions of\ntheir commuting.",
        "We also shared with the participants a representation\n\n145\n\nCecile Boulard et al.",
        "of the financial costs and COz emissions for each day.",
        "All the\nfigures produced on the commuting of the participants were\npresented to them during interviews with all the required\nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.",
        "The goal\nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the\ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those\nfigures made them think about their commuting practices and\nchoices.",
        "We audio-recorded all interviews and collected participants’\ndiary entries.",
        "We describe our findings in next section.",
        "rather having a_ pre-existing representation\n\n3 Findings\nDuring the analysis, the emerging central theme was related to\nthe difficulties that participants faced during the interview in\nunderstanding and accepting the figures emerging from their\ncommuting habits.",
        "The eco-calculator model takes a socially and\npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it\nto measurable reference units like COz emissions and cost.",
        "Even\nwithin a sample of people with a clear disposition towards\nquestioning their own environmental impact and their habits,\nthere was a tendency to perceive the figures as incomplete and\npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into\nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices\nthe to them\nspecifically.",
        "The findings that we report here come from the last phase of\nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to\n\nvis-a-vis transportation options available\n\nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.",
        "3.1 Understanding the data\n\n3.1.1 Grasping abstract quantities.",
        "As already reported in [12],\nwhen facing data without having access to information on the\ncontext or to a baseline, users may struggle to make sense of\nthem.",
        "I can’t appreciate it.”\n(P6).",
        "This is an issue as it does not support users in taking\nactions to change their behaviors toward greener practices.",
        "Alongside the difficulty in\ncontextualizing abstract quantities on a (potentially normative)\nscale, users also faced a challenge in understanding what the\nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.",
        "Here, P3 meant that the choice of dividing the price of the\nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.",
        "the working days, did not fit\nwith her representation of cost of the monthly pass.",
        "For her, it\nmeant that she could get in a bus or tram anytime, any day in\nthe month and so the cost of this pass should have been\ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.",
        "She explained that this\nwould have seemed fairer to the representation that she had of\nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.",
        "“So in the end the combination\nbus + kick scooter is more expensive than the one with the car?",
        "When the model fails to represent specific situations.",
        "Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is\nused to commute either with car-sharing, or by bus or by car\n\n146\n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom\n\nsolo.",
        "According to the eco-calculator model used in the study,\nthe greener option was car-sharing.",
        "When the researcher explained that to P9, he was\nsurprised and said: “Ah...",
        "3.2.2.",
        "So,\nwhen during the second interview the researcher explained to\nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of COz per day and that it\nwas quite high compared to other participants, she said: “I don’t\nunderstand, I only take the train and ride my bike.” In her\nrepresentation, P8 only considered the type of means of\ntransport to assess if it produced a high or low impact on the\nenvironment.",
        "The data allowed the participant to realize\nthat she had a biased understanding of the environmental\nfootprint.",
        "But even when there is\nsome basic understanding of each single element of the\ncomputation, the level where the data are computed (based on a\nspecific model) causes problems to individuals as they need to\nappreciate how the resulting data have been computed.",
        "There is\na need to understand the model, to then be able to appreciate the\nfigures built upon it.",
        "A main reason why the eco-calculator model was leading to\ninconsistencies was that there was an implicit intent that the\nmodel should have supported explicitly [18] and that we\ndiscovered was not doing that so well.",
        "Either the model inadequately\ncomputes the CO2 emissions for feedback at an individual level,\neither car-sharing is really less polluting than public\ntransportation and in that case it would be worth to\nacknowledge that and act accordingly.",

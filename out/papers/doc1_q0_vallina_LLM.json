Figure 1) for smartphones that allows for tracking expenses by taking pictures of receipts to extract relevant entities such as the total sum, store name, single articles and their corresponding prices, and a categorization of both the receipt and each article.\"\n7. \"The paper is structured as follows: we first review the challenges in performing OCR in the receipt analysis domain by inspecting German receipts from different stores, and report the results of an online study.\"\n8. \"To evaluate our approach, we developed a smartphone application based on a receipt analysis and an online questionnaire in which users are able to track expenses by taking photos of receipts, and solve microtasks to enhance the recognition.\"",

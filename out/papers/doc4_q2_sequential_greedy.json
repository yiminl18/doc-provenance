        "The implication of this tagline is that having knowledge of\nthe metrics measured by this shirt — heart rate, heart rate\nvariability, breathing rate, breathing volume, steps,\ncadence, and calories — will lead the wearer to a better life.",
        "This raises several questions.",
        "Routine and Motivation\n\nHCI and Ubicomp researchers have studied ways to\nincrease motivation to participate in healthy or socially\ndesirable behaviors.",
        "According to rational choice theory, consumers\nmake decisions based on maximizing the benefit to them,\nbased on their individual preferences, goals, and options\n[13].",
        "Studies of Smart Devices\n\nResearchers have explored the ways smart devices can be\nadopted into routines or build motivation.",
        "Researchers have\nexplored smart devices for purposes as diverse as\nencouraging more environmentally friendly behavior (e.g.",
        "Activity trackers have been used extensively in this\ndomain, as have various sensors documenting other aspects\nimportant to health (such as sensors that monitor UV\nexposure [8]).",
        "outlined the ways these devices encourage wellness,\nincluding tracking and feedback, goal setting, social\ninfluence, and gamification [14].",
        "Some researchers have even allowed participants in studies\nto design their own input devices [2].",
        "Another approach is\n\n636\n\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7-11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN\n\nto utilize a combination of commercially available and\nprototype interfaces.",
        "Examples of this approach are Walsh\net al.’s StepCity, which used commercially available Fitbits\nas an interface for a social game that they designed [25],\nand Lin et al.’s Fish’n’Steps, a virtual pet that responded to\nthe number of steps taken by participants wearing\ncommercially available pedometers [19].",
        "One example is participants who have\nattended physical therapy, which were the population\nstudied by Ananthanarayan et al.",
        "in the evaluation of a\nwearable prototype to assist in knee rehabilitation [1].",
        "Another group of highly motivated people are those who\nmay not have had specific physical disabilities or conditions\nbut were recruited for their interest in increasing physical\nactivity, such as participants in trials of UbiFit Garden, an\nactivity tracker integrated with a mobile phone that\nprovides users with a glanceable symbolic representation of\ngoal adherence [6][7].",
        "Another user base that has been studied extensively are\nusers who had integrated smart devices into their lives at\nthe point of study.",
        "Rooksby et al.",
        "interviewed a group of\nparticipants, the majority of whom were using activity\ntrackers at the start of the study [13].",
        "They found that\npersonal tracking was enmeshed in these participants’ lives\n(which they called ‘lived informatics) and that people\nchanged the tracker they used depending on their current\nshort-term or long-term goal.",
        "Fritz et al.",
        "interviewed\nparticipants, all of whom were using activity trackers at the\ntime of the interview [9].",
        "Even under changing goals and\npractices over time, participants derived value and\nmotivation from use of devices, even over long periods of\nuse.",
        "Li et al.",
        "administered surveys and interviews to\nindividuals engaged in personal data tracking and identified\nbarriers that occurred through the different stages of using\nsmart devices that they identified [16].",
        "Choe et al.",
        "investigated\nhow a group of Quantified-Selfers (whom they define as an\n“extreme users”) collected and explored personal data [5].",
        "These users created workarounds to manage barriers of the\ntechnologies they used, and many built their own smart\ndevices and systems.",
        "Implications from this study included\nways to support users in self-experimentation and reflecting\non data.",
        "A common finding in the studies described above\nis that participants successfully integrate the devices into\ntheir lives by either modifying the devices or their routines,\nand that they were willing to and interested in finding ways\nto work around device barriers.",
        "examined the ways personal\npreferences and _ characteristics affected use and\nabandonment of Fitbit activity trackers given to college\nstudents over six weeks [22].",
        "Participants abandoned Fitbits\nquickly (65% stopped using them at two weeks) and had\nissues remembering to wear the device.",
        "Though this study\nexplored users who are not highly motivated, users used\ndevices manufactured by a single company, which does not\nexpose barriers across devices.",
        "Below, we describe a study in which participants who were\nnot recruited based on acute health needs or having\nintegrated devices into their lives were given funds to\npurchase whichever devices they wished to use.",
        "We explore\nquestions around use and abandonment of devices.",
        "Some participants\ntold other participants about the devices they had\npurchased, and because of this, certain devices were bought\nby many participants.",
        "Typically lasting about one hour, the semi-structured\ninterview also ascertained if and why the devices were still\nin regular use, whether participants experienced any\nbenefits or disadvantages from using the devices, as well as\nprevious experiences with smart devices.",
        "Participants\n\n17 participants (13 male) were recruited.",
        "Five were in the age category 18-\n29, three 30-39, six 40-49, and three 50-59.",
        "Three had\ncompleted some college, ten had bachelor’s degrees, three\nhad master’s degrees, and one had a PhD.",
        "One person identified as Hispanic/Latino.",
        "Second,\nthese participants were more likely to know how to\ntroubleshoot devices on their own, thus less likely to\nabandon devices due to technical issues.",
        "health, productivity) that\nthey wished to pursue.",
        "In other words, participants may be\nable to troubleshoot the devices, but they will not\nnecessarily know the best ways to apply the devices\ntowards their goals.",
        "Analysis\n\nAll interviews were audio recorded and_ transcribed.",
        "Detailed notes from interviews and transcripts were\nanalyzed using open and axial coding by two of the\nresearchers to identify emergent themes.",
        "The coding\nscheme was discussed and finalized.",
        "Once the coding\nscheme was finalized, all interview data was then coded and\nshared with the research team.",
        "As themes emerged, they\nwere merged into the codebook.",
        "Participant goals and devices\n\nWhat were participant goals?",
        "During the initial interviews at the start of the study,\nparticipants expressed a range of goals, from increasing\nfitness to reducing pain to playing Ping-Pong better (see\nTable 1).",
        "Most of these goals (13) pertained to mental or\nphysical health and fitness, two to improving performance\nat a sport, and three to improving productivity or focus.",
        "Given that participants could choose any goal, it is\ninteresting that the majority chose health and fitness, which\nmay be the result of the current marketing of commercially\navailable smart devices.",
        "Surprisingly, devices purchased often did not appear to map\nto goals.",
        "For example, P7 purchased the Misfit Shine, a\nwearable pedometer, although his goal was to reduce his\nneck and shoulder pain.",
        "This suggests that either users may\nnot have the expertise of how devices would suit their goals\nor users may not have the expertise of how their goals can\n\n\nbe reached.",
        "Interestingly, though participants were free to purchase any\ntype of device, the majority purchased wearable devices.",
        "Participants abandoned almost 80% of devices purchased\nfor this study within the first two months (see Table 2).",
        "Did not fit with their conceptions of themselves\n\nParticipants frequently referred to other types of people (as\nopposed to themselves) for whom devices might be more\nuseful.",
        "Participants did not know what\nto do with the data: as P12 said, “It gave me a lot of\ninformation, but I don't know what to do with any of this\ninformation.... My heart rate is this much.",
        "We categorize the ways the devices were\nuseful as major benefits and minor benefits, and momentary\nsmall benefits and benefits from “non-smart” features.",
        "He\nexplained that he “felt cheated” when he heard that the\ndevice was not accurate, and that it bothered him because\n“If [the heart rate measurements were] not objectively\naccurate, I was going by some number they produced and I\ndidn't know whether to believe it or not.” He went on to say\nthat he still used the strategies he had learned from using\nthe heart rate monitor, but had “stopped relying on the\nsensor’.",
        "These findings have\nimplications for the design of the next generation of smart\ndevices that more closely meet the needs of users.",

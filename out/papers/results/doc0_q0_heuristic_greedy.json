        "One recognized use of personal informatics is to support change\nmanagement [17].",
        "The link between self-tracking and change\nmanagement is in the reflexive position that users can adopt\nregarding their behaviors [19].",
        "Based on the collected data and\non the change that the user wants to achieve, personal\ninformatics support the user by tracking progress toward a\ndesired direction.",
        "Many studies have focused on activity trackers that track the\nnumber of steps, the quality of sleep, the heart pulsation or\nburned calories.",
        "The majority of self-tracking practices target the\ndomain of health and well-being [11], where models are fairly\nsimple: a step is a step, the number of heart pulsations, and the\nnumber of calories burned.",
        "Despite the required low level of\nknowledge and relative simplicity of the underlying models,\nsome studies have already reported the difficulty that users may\nencounter when having to interpret the figures provided by the\ntrackers [12, 15].",
        "When considering the sustainable mobility domain, we can\nexpect the difficulty of people in relating to the numbers to even\nincrease, since the phenomena are much more complex and\ndifficult to reduce.",

        "Current online tools for eco-feedback on mobility are based\non disaggregated data among the various means of transport\n[10].",
        "This means that for any mode of transport and a given\ndistance, there is a cost and an amount of COz emission that are\nassociated (for instance an average COz emission per distance\nand per passenger for public transport).",
        "However, as the\ncomputation is complex and is based on a range of factors\n(owning a car, having a public transport monthly pass, ride-\nsharing), it is difficult for a person to construct an accurate\npersonal estimation of the impact of commuting practices [3, 8,\n23].",
        "There are studies on tools supporting greener mobility\npractices [4, 5, 9, 14, 16], but to the best of our knowledge, none\nof them details and discusses the model underlying the\ncomputation.",
        "2 Method and Settings\n\nIn order to study how people understand and accept figures of\nCOz emissions and costs due to commuting, a diary study has\nbeen conducted.",
        "We have chosen this methodology as it is\ndifficult to gather information on commuting practices through\nobservation over a long period of time.",
        "We involved a group of ten participants recruited through a\nsnowball sampling.",
        "The ages varied from 27 to 56.",
        "Our\nparticipants were all professionals, qualified as engineers,\ncomputer scientists, doctors, technicians, school teachers and\nsales assistants.",
        "The diary study was divided into three main steps.",
        "The first\none was a face-to-face semi-directed interview with the\nparticipants where they described precisely their commuting\npractices: the means of transport used, the reasons for choosing\na given means of transport on a given day, the preferences that\nthey may have for one or another means of transport and the\nconstraints they may have in their professional or personal lives\nfor commuting.",
        "In the second phase of the study, the participants filled a pen\nand paper diary during 20 working days.",
        "Each day, they had to\nindicate the date, the means of transport used that day and the\nreason why they made that choice, if any.",
        "After the 20 days, the\nparticipants returned their diaries and we were then able to\ncompute all the figures regarding the cost and COz emissions of\ntheir commuting.",
        "The computation of the financial cost and COz\nemission figures was manually performed and based on typical\ncarbon footprint calculators publicly available at the time of the\nstudy [10], indicated as the eco-calculator in the rest of the\npaper.",
        "The third part of the study was a second interview with the\nparticipants, where we provided them with a compacted view of\ntheir commuting practices over the 20 days, where for each day,\nwe represent for the user the means of transport used to go to\ncommute.",
        "We also shared with the participants a representation\n\n145\n\nCecile Boulard et al.",
        "of the financial costs and COz emissions for each day.",
        "All the\nfigures produced on the commuting of the participants were\npresented to them during interviews with all the required\nexplanations in order to allow them to make sense of it.",
        "The goal\nof the second interview was to provide the participants with the\ncompiled figures and then to discuss with them if and how those\nfigures made them think about their commuting practices and\nchoices.",
        "We audio-recorded all interviews and collected participants’\ndiary entries.",
        "All the interviews were entirely transcribed and\nanalyzed together with the diaries.",
        "We identified themes using a\nthematic analysis [7].",
        "For this study, we inductively identified\nthemes starting from the data trying to find commonalities\nthan of\nunderstanding.",
        "We describe our findings in next section.",
        "rather having a_ pre-existing representation\n\n3 Findings\nDuring the analysis, the emerging central theme was related to\nthe difficulties that participants faced during the interview in\nunderstanding and accepting the figures emerging from their\ncommuting habits.",
        "The eco-calculator model takes a socially and\npolitically rich concept like environmental impact and reduces it\nto measurable reference units like COz emissions and cost.",
        "Even\nwithin a sample of people with a clear disposition towards\nquestioning their own environmental impact and their habits,\nthere was a tendency to perceive the figures as incomplete and\npossibly unfair, as well as a difficulty in translating the data into\nactionable feedback, that is to say using it to make better choices\nthe to them\nspecifically.",
        "The findings that we report here come from the last phase of\nthe study which is indeed the second interview when we gave to\n\nvis-a-vis transportation options available\n\nthe participants’ feedback on their commuting practices.",
        "3.1 Understanding the data\n\n3.1.1 Grasping abstract quantities.",
        "As already reported in [12],\nwhen facing data without having access to information on the\ncontext or to a baseline, users may struggle to make sense of\nthem.",
        "A difficulty we observed was in positioning COz emission\nfigures on some kind of directional scale — i.e.",
        "is it a little or a lot,\ngood or bad, and in relation to what?",
        "For instance, after the\nresearcher told P6 that she emitted 4000g of COz per day, she\nasked and commented: “Is it quite good?",
        "I can’t appreciate it.”\n(P6).",
        "This is an issue as it does not support users in taking\nactions to change their behaviors toward greener practices.",
        "It\ndemonstrates that there is a need to build a baseline of COz\nemissions in order to help users to position their (commuting)\npractices also with respect to other people and for comparing the\ndifferent options available in terms of means of transport.",
        "3.1.2 Understanding the model.",
        "Alongside the difficulty in\ncontextualizing abstract quantities on a (potentially normative)\nscale, users also faced a challenge in understanding what the\nmodel actually took into account and what it left out.",
        "This can be\nan issue when it comes to the perceived (un)fairness of the\nmodel (which we will discuss later), but also when weighting\n\n\n“Il Don’t Understand...” Issues in Self-Quantifying Commuting\n\nfinancial costs against environmental impact.",
        "P7 who was\nmainly riding a bike or using the tramway to go to work, and\nonly occasionally using the car, identified some limits of the\ncosts representation, presented during the second interview: “I\nchanged the tires on my bike during the course of the study.",
        "It was\nnecessary, but you did not integrate this in the costs.” (P7)\n\nBecause the cost of acquiring and maintaining of the owned\nmeans of transport were not included in the costs computed by\nthe eco-calculator the numbers presented to P7 were perceived\nas not complete.",
        "In a similar way, P3 who regularly took the public transport,\nquestioned the cost associated to the monthly pass.",
        "As she\nexplained: “then there is a small correction factor that can refine\nthe calculation of the cost, that is that you consider only the\nworking days whereas we can use the pass also in the week-end”.",
        "Here, P3 meant that the choice of dividing the price of the\nmonthly pass only over 20 days, i.e.",
        "the working days, did not fit\nwith her representation of cost of the monthly pass.",
        "For her, it\nmeant that she could get in a bus or tram anytime, any day in\nthe month and so the cost of this pass should have been\ncomputed over the 30 days of the month.",
        "She explained that this\nwould have seemed fairer to the representation that she had of\nthe cost associated to the monthly pass.",
        "The last situation we highlight in this section refers to P10\nwho got used to go to work with a combination of means of\ntransport: bus and kick scooter.",
        "“So in the end the combination\nbus + kick scooter is more expensive than the one with the car?",
        "I\ndon’t understand.” P10 expressed the incoherence that he\nperceived between the figures proposed by the diary and his own\nrepresentation of costs.",
        "After this feedback, the researcher had to\nexplain and detail what is in the cost associated to driving (in\nthis case only the fuel consumed for the trip) and the cost of the\ncombination bus + kick scooter (the cost of one bus ticket).",
        "As\nthe distance home-work is relatively small for P10 (less than\n8km), and he had a small car with a low fuel consumption, the\ncost of the fuel for 8 km was less than a ticket in the bus.",
        "The\nlimit of this computation of course is that it reduces the cost of\nthe car to fuel consumption whereas the real cost of (owning and\ndriving) a car is much higher than that.",
        "3.2 Accepting the data\n\n3.2.1.",
        "When the model fails to represent specific situations.",
        "The\nmain objective of simulating a tool tracking commuting practices\nwith a diary was to get a first evaluation of what could be its\nrole, if any, in incentivizing users to adopt greener means of\ntransport.",
        "It is therefore critical that the data is not only\nunderstandable, as discussed in the previous section, but also\nperceived as fair.",
        "Tracking data about CO2 emissions singles\nindividuals and families out and questions their habits (and\npotentially their privileges) vis-a-vis a global problem.",
        "But to do\nso effectively the model has to be able to properly contextualize\nthe behavior of individuals and family units within the overall\nenvironmental impact of the collective (the city or metropolitan\narea, the country, etc.).",
        "Participant P9 lives more than 35 km away from work and is\nused to commute either with car-sharing, or by bus or by car\n\n146\n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom\n\nsolo.",
        "According to the eco-calculator model used in the study,\nthe greener option was car-sharing.",
        "The calculator was showing\nthat there were less COz emissions with car-sharing than with\nthe bus.",
        "When the researcher explained that to P9, he was\nsurprised and said: “Ah...",
        "I emitted less COz in car-sharing than in\nbus”.",
        "The researcher explained again how the emissions of CO2\nfor public transport are computed (each passenger on a bus emits\n103,3 g of COz per km).",
        "In a similar situation, P5 said “which\nwould mean that car-sharing would produce less COz than a bus\neven when it is full?”.",
        "This result was really surprising for P5 and\nP9 because it did not comply with the reality of facts as they\nperceived them.",
        "When P9 chose to go by bus, his car was not\nused over the trip whereas when he chose the option of car-\nsharing, the bus was circulating anyway.",
        "So, from his\nperspective, the travel by bus cannot correspond to a higher\nemission of COz than the travel by car-sharing, because there is\none less car on the road.",
        "To go further, P10 added: “yeah the thing about the bus is that\nyou are not responsible for the itinerary, you use something that is\nthere regardless and you do not directly emit anything.” Which\nexpressed the gap between a global representation this\nparticipant had in opposition to a model that was providing daily\nfeedback at an individual level.",
        "3.2.2.",
        "Challenging self-representations.",
        "The previous example\nshows that an oversimplified and incomplete model can create\nconfusion on the relationship between individual and collective\nmeans of transport and one’s individual impact on COz\nwithin their community.",
        "This\nproblematic given that one of the explicit goals of this type of\n\nemissions is particularly\ntool is to help people challenge their self-representation and\ntheir habits.",
        "The potential consequences of a naive or uninformed\nunderstanding of one’s own habits is illustrated by the reaction\nof participant P8, working at almost 40 km from her place and\nhighly motivated in reducing her environmental footprint.",
        "So,\nwhen during the second interview the researcher explained to\nthe participant that she emitted 6200g of COz per day and that it\nwas quite high compared to other participants, she said: “I don’t\nunderstand, I only take the train and ride my bike.” In her\nrepresentation, P8 only considered the type of means of\ntransport to assess if it produced a high or low impact on the\nenvironment.",
        "She had put aside the fact that when you live far\nfrom your workplace, the COz emissions due to transport are\nnecessarily higher.",
        "The data allowed the participant to realize\nthat she had a biased understanding of the environmental\nfootprint.",
        "But while in this case the COz measurement provided\nby the model was helpful, it required an explanation on the part\nof the researcher to contextualize the data to this person’s\nspecific situation.",
        "4 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nThe research presented in this paper illustrates a situation where\ndata of self-behaviors put the users at unease.",
        "The difficulties\nthat can be encountered by individuals when facing data of self-\n\n\nECCE 2019, September 10-13, 2019, BELFAST, <, United Kingdom\n\nbehaviors can be grouped in two main categories: understanding\ndata and accepting data.",
        "There is a category of situations where individuals encounter\ndifficulties in understanding data.",
        "It is possible that data are hard\nto grasp because even the basic units that are used are too\nabstract and far from a known reference.",
        "But even when there is\nsome basic understanding of each single element of the\ncomputation, the level where the data are computed (based on a\nspecific model) causes problems to individuals as they need to\nappreciate how the resulting data have been computed.",
        "There is\na need to understand the model, to then be able to appreciate the\nfigures built upon it.",
        "The second level relates more to the notion of accepting the\ndata.",
        "For that, the study show that people need to make a\ncomparison between the gathered figures and the representation\nthey have of themselves in their practices, commuting in our\ncase.",
        "If there is a gap between the figures given and their self-\nrepresentation, the participants, expressed misunderstanding\nand also judged the figures as being unfair.",
        "A main reason why the eco-calculator model was leading to\ninconsistencies was that there was an implicit intent that the\nmodel should have supported explicitly [18] and that we\ndiscovered was not doing that so well.",
        "The intent of the eco-\ncalculator was to support the adoption of greener practices.",
        "What appeared as an outcome was that, for several participants,\nthe use of the bus led to more COz emissions than car-sharing or\nmoped.",
        "This conclusion would be very likely in opposition to\nwhat public authorities and common sense perceive as green\ntransportation practices.",
        "Either the model inadequately\ncomputes the CO2 emissions for feedback at an individual level,\neither car-sharing is really less polluting than public\ntransportation and in that case it would be worth to\nacknowledge that and act accordingly.",
        "We believe that this work can be inspiring for the quantified-\nself community about ways to answer to the need to better\ncontextualize tracked data [6].",

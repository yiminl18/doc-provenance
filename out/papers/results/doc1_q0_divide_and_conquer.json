        "We based our approach on an online\nquestionnaire to gain information about participants shop-\nping behavior, their interest in keeping track of expenses and\ntheir attitude towards automatic receipt capturing, as well as\non a receipt analysis to obtain insights about technical chal-\nlenges in this field.",
        "In a three-week-long user study, we were\nable to show that our approach was appreciated by the users\nand eases keeping track of expenses subjectively.",
        "This miti-\ngates the main reason for not keeping track of expenses: the\nhigh effort involved.",
        "We furthermore were able to show that\nour approach significantly reduces the error rate for captured\nreceipts, and that the outcome of crowd-solved microtasks\ncan be used to enhance recognition for new receipts as well.",
        "Moreover, we found evidence that gamification provided ad-\nditional motivation to users to contribute more, solve a higher\namount of microtasks and thereby enrich the database.",
        "In future work we plan to investigate the long-term effects of\nour approach to test in how far the error-rate further decreases\nwhen accumulating more data and whether gamfication can\nbe used to keep users engaged over a longer timespan.",
        "There-\nfore we aim to conduct an in-the-wild study and release the\napp in the market.",

        "This can be explained by the way the question-\nnaire was promoted (social media and student mailing lists).",
        "Asked for causes, participants stated that the main\nreason is the high amount of effort to track expenses manu-\nally (stated by 57.98%).",
        "We therefore conclude that our pro-\ntotype needs to ease the process of tracking expenses (R1).",
        "Participants reported visiting weekly farmer’s markets and\nother specialized markets at least infrequently (5.88%), which\nmakes a manual way to record expenses necessary (R2), since\nthere are not always receipts provided.",
        "These two find-\nings suggest that an application for mobile devices is the most\nsuitable platform for our system (R3).",
        "Still, 16.38% would want every single item catego-\nrized, and 27.31% want both (single items and the whole pur-\nchase).",
        "Informal Budgeting App Review\n\nAfter establishing requirements based on the online question-\nnaire, we informally reviewed 10 budgeting apps, with a spe-\ncial focus on popular apps as reported in [2], to establish a\ncore set of requirements for our prototype.",
        "Based on the\nreview, we additionally identified 10 different categories by\ntaking the most provided categories within the applications\ninto account.",
        "For example, Von Ahn and Dabbish [36] developed the ESP\nGame, in which randomly paired players see images they\nneed to tag.",
        "Every time they agree on a word, they receive\npoints and the word is accepted as a valid tag.",
        "Another example showing that a crowd\nnot only succeeds in categorizing entities based on images,\nbut outperforms single users in this task, can be seen in Les-\nsel et al.",
        "The authors make use of crowdsourcing to\ngenerate classifications of waste that was inserted into an aug-\nmented recycling bin.",
        "By typing the correspond-\ning word, users can confirm they are human and indirectly\nfix OCR errors.",
        "These findings support our idea of\nusing a crowd to correct errors in extracted entities.",
        "Nevertheless, the reCAPTCHA system is used to cor-\nrect OCR errors without regarding semantic coherences, as\nwe do in order to identify and match articles and prices.",
        "More\nthan 9,000 users corrected over 12.5 million lines of text,\nand the number of volunteers participating in this platform\nis growing further [31].",
        "This approach also shows the suc-\ncess of a crowd correcting erroneous text regions.",
        "However,\nin line with the reCAPTCHA approach, the focus of ANDP\nis not to provide microtasks to gain semantic coherences or to\nuse collected information to improve an extraction algorithm,\nas covered by our work.",
        "Since both approaches used regular expressions\nfor the extraction of entities with low variety, we adapted this\ntechnique in our algorithm.",
        "To our knowledge, our approach is the first investigating\ncrowdsourcing to reduce the error rate when extracting rele-\nvant entities for expense tracking.",
        "Using gamification to mo-\ntivate the crowd enables our system to run in a self-sustained\nmanner and furthermore allows to investigate the effects and\nthe perception of gamification in this domain.",
        "To our knowledge, there seems to be no other\nwork considering the identification and extraction of single\narticles together with respective prices and categories based\non a photographed receipt.",
        "In contrast to existing approaches\nmaking use of crowdsourcing only to correct text errors, we\ngo a step further and use microtasks to obtain semantically\nrelevant information to enhance our recognition algorithm.",
        "SYSTEM DESIGN\n\nTo evaluate our approach, we developed a budgeting appli-\ncation that allows for tracking expenses by taking pictures of\nreceipts.",
        "To enhance the recognition algo-\nrithm, we used the outcome of different gamified microtasks\nthat were solved by an unpaid crowd.",
        "To accomplish R3, we decided\nto target mobile devices and implemented our prototype as an\nAndroid application.",
        "This also seems to be beneficial regard-\ning the ease of tracking expenses (cf.",
        "Participants were also asked to solve 25\nmicrotasks including all task types.",

        "We decided to outsource the whole\nextraction to the user’s smartphone to keep the traffic as low\nas possible for the user and reduce the workload on the web-\nserver, to which the result containing recognized text and cor-\nresponding line numbers is sent.",

        "where the receipt is located in the picture.",
        "The remaining regions were con-\nsolidated to form another bounding box which represents the\nregion where the receipt is located (represented by the red line\nin Figure 5d).",

        "Moreover, as our anal-\nysis revealed, the header may contain entities like the store’s\naddress, its URL and the phone number, which serve as store\nidentifiers and can be determined using regular expressions.",
        "Once store identifiers are extracted, they can be looked up\nin the database to find a matching store and thereby over-\ncome Cl.",
        "Next, we iterate over all lines in the body and perform\na fulltext search as well as use Levenshteins distance [23] to\nfind the content of this line in our database, which contains\nthe outcome of all crowd-solved microtasks.",
        "We search in\nthe table containing the corrected versions of entities but also\nin the table containing the raw, possibly erroneous OCR ver-\nsion of entities to compensate for spelling errors.",
        "Using these\nclassifications, we can match one of the patterns we found in\nthe receipts analysis (cf.",

        "In the app, each microtask is shown isolated and\nconsist of an image of the unknown receipt line and a short\ntask description, following the suggestions given for crowd\nuser interfaces in [30].",

        "If a microtask is skipped by at least six users, we discard the\npicture, similar to [37], as it cannot be used to infer proper in-\nformation.",
        "We decided to use three different task types, which\nwe assume to be helpful to match articles and prices, to ex-\ntract the total sum, and to categorize articles and the overall\nexpense (cf.",
        "Figure 6):\n\nClassification Microtasks\n\nBased on the receipt analysis we identified three different\ntypes for entities: article names, additional information\n(e.g.",

        "This means that problems that occur\nwhen analyzing a receipt of a user who solves many micro-\ntasks of the crowd are delegated and potentially solved faster\nthan problems of users solving few microtasks for others.",
        "Ad-\nditionally, we integrated a leaderboard (cf.",

        "H1 is motivated by findings from our online study suggesting\nthat users are interested in keeping track of expenses but shy\naway from the huge effort involved.",
        "Since our system allows\ncapturing receipts by photographing them, we assume that we\nease the capture of expenses.",
        "H2 builds on the assumption\n\n\nIUI 2016 * Social Media\n\nthat our approach using the outcomes of crowd-solved micro-\ntasks lowers the error rate, compared to a baseline without\nany crowd-based data, when extracting relevant information\nfrom captured receipts.",
        "H3 is based on the assumption that\nsolving a certain microtask not only affects a single receipt,\nbut helps to improve other receipts to be captured in the fu-\nture as well.",
        "If we can show that our approach works, i.e.",
        "that\na crowd solving microtasks indeed leads to a lower error rate\nwhen extracting entities from receipts, the question remains\nopen how to motivate a crowd to solve microtasks without us-\ning monetary incentives.",
        "This leads to H4 which is motivated\nby the related work [6, 13,21, 36] showing that gamification\nhas positive effects in crowdsourcing.",
        "Method\n\nWe let participants use our prototype for three weeks and\nasked them to capture their expenses.",
        "At the beginning of the\nstudy, the app was locked and automatically generated a pass-\nword.",

        "Only after finishing\nthis questionnaire was the app unlocked.",
        "To investigate H4, gamification elements were not visible in\nthe first week, so as to acquire a baseline.",
        "We decided against\na counterbalanced measures design (i.e.",
        "In this questionnaire we provided questions\nabout the app usage, how tracking expenses was perceived\nby the participants, how motivated they were towards solv-\ning microtasks, and what could be done to increase their\nmotivation.",
        "After this questionnaire was finished, the app\nwas unlocked again and all gamification elements activated.",
        "Two weeks later, participants were asked to take part in\nthe post-session questionnaire, which had similar questions\nas the mid-questionnaire for purposes of comparison.",
        "We\nasked questions about how tracking expenses was perceived\nand whether participants were motivated to solve microtasks.",
        "Furthermore, we investigated whether certain game elements\nwere considered motivational or not, and provided questions\nrelated to how far our system eases keeping track of expenses.",
        "Both the mid-session as well as the post-session question-\nnaire, were used to investigate H1 by posing questions about\nhow the approach was perceived subjectively concerning ease\nof expense tracking.",
        "We used 5-point Likert scales to mea-\nsure agreement with statements participants were shown to.",
        "During the study, we logged all receipts that were added by\nthe participants together with all solved microtasks to inves-\ntigate H2 and H3.",
        "In order to calculate an error rate, we\nneeded to provide a ground truth for comparison with results\nof our approach.",
        "Therefore, we went through all receipts and\nclassified, categorized and corrected all lines of these receipts\nmanually.",
        "This was done in two steps: One person provided\na ground truth for each line of every receipt that was added\nby the participants and the other one checked for errors (e.g.",

        "Con-\ncerning their buying behavior, participants visit same stores\n(M=4.42, SD=0.52, Mdn=4) and tend to buy the same prod-\nucts (M=4.33, SD=0.49, Mdn=4).",
        "Perception of the Prototype\n\nParticipants stated in the post-session questionnaire that the\napp eases tracking expenses (M=3.91, SD=1.04, Mdn=4)\nand that they would rather use our system than manually\ntrack their expenses (M=4, SD=1.18, Mdn=4).",
        "Moreover,\nthey considered capturing expenses by taking pictures of re-\nceipts to be easy (M=4.45, SD=0.68, Mdn=5) and perceived\nthe smiley as helpful for taking a good picture (M=4.27,\nSD=1.35, Mdn=5).",
        "These findings provide evidence support-\ning H1: the prototype eases keeping track of expenses.",
        "More-\nover, crowd corrections were perceived positively (M=4.38,\nSD=0.74, Mdn=4.5) and considered meaningful (M=4.5,\nSD=0.54, Mdn=4.5).",
        "To obtain an error ratio\nfor each receipt, we analyzed every captured receipt again,\nusing the outcome of all microtasks (classifications and cor-\nrections) solved by the crowd (crowd-enhanced algorithm,\nCE), and compared the result with an approach that solely\n\n\nIUI 2016 * Social Media\n\nrelies on assumptions concluded by the receipt analysis with-\nout considering the crowd (baseline algorithm).",
        "Since it is\nimpossible to deduce categories of articles for the baseline\nalgorithm (that does not utilize any crowd data), we excluded\nthe category in the error rate to obtain comparable results.",
        "Thus, the error rate is calculated by the ratio of the amount of\nwrong entities (wrong classification and/or wrong value of a\nline) to the overall amount of entities (right classification of a\nreceipt line and correct value).",
        "A paired\nt-test showed a significant effect between these error rates\n(t(190)=12.47, p<0.01) supporting evidence for H2: the out-\ncome of designated microtasks solved by a crowd can be used\nto reduce the error rate of captured receipts.",
        "To evaluate whether microtasks of one receipt can be used\nto enhance newly added receipts, we picked a random sub-\nsample with 15 to 150 receipts (10 iterations, increasing the\nsubsample size by 15 each time) and used this as a training\nsample.",
        "We then iterated over all receipts that were not con-\ntained in this subsample (the test sample) and applied both the\ncrowd-enhanced algorithm as well as the baseline algorithm.",
        "In the CE algorithm, we only considered solutions of micro-\ntasks that were related to unknown entities of receipts within\nthe selected training sample to enhance receipts in the test\nsample.",
        "Since participants subjectively claimed to buy the\nsame products, we additionally performed a crowd-enhanced\nparticipants exclusive (CEPE) algorithm in which we used re-\nceipts of one user for the test set and the receipts of all other\nusers as training sample to avoid having receipts of the same\nuser in the test set and in the training sample.",
        "To receive\nmore reliable results, we repeated the subsample selection 50\ntimes for each sample size.",
        "The results sup-\nport H3: the outcome of microtasks solved by a crowd can\nbe used to reduce the error rate of new receipts that are un-\nknown to the system, since both the CE and the CEPE algo-\nrithm outperform the baseline algorithm in all sample sizes.",
        "We conducted a repeated measurements ANOVA and found\na significant effect between the algorithms (p<0.05).",
        "Pair-\nwise comparisons using the Bonferroni method revealed that\nthe difference between the CE algorithm and the baseline is\nsignificant (p<0.01), as well as the difference between the\nCEPE algorithm and the baseline (p<0.01).",

        "The conducted analysis to measure\nthe error ratio of receipts revealed that the crowd-based ap-\nproach is able to significantly enhance the extraction of rele-\nvant information, as it produces roughly only a third as many\nerrors as the baseline approach, showing evidence for H2.",
        "However, the differences to the baseline\nare not very high, which most probably is explainable by the\nrelatively low size of the crowd (12 participants) and the lim-\nited time of our study (3 weeks) leading to a relatively low\namount of data.",
        "An explanation why newly added, system unknown receipts\ncan be enhanced, lies in the increasing amount of collected\ndata which raises the chance of finding receipt entities in the\ndatabase.",
        "The reason why the CE approach performs better\nthan the CEPE approach might be because of the fact that par-\nticipants tend to buy the same articles and visit same stores\n(as they have reported), which increases the chance to have\nsame articles in the test and in the training set.",
        "This, on the\nother hand, is beneficial for an approach as done by us, since\na user that is solving her own tasks can thereby improve the\nalgorithm to better recognize her products in the future.",
        "The\nnumber of solved microtasks was significantly influenced by\nthe use of gamification: It increased dramatically in the sec-\nond week after gamification was introduced and subjectively,\nsolving crowd-tasks appeared to be more fun.",
        "These results show supporting evi-\ndence for H4.",
        "Nonetheless, as we only investigated the pro-\ntotype short-term, it is questionable whether this is only a\nnovelty effect.",
        "Moreover, the high variance of solved tasks\nper user suggests that the gamification elements are not mo-\ntivating for all users.",
        "An explanation for this can be found\nin [17] showing that competition, as was used in our system,\ncan also be demotivating.",
        "Figure 9 also shows that two partic-\nipants were not interested in solving microtasks, independent\nof whether gamification was active or not, thus necessitating\nfurther incentive mechanisms.",
        "Again, a long-term study with\nmore participants seems suitable to explore the impacts of\ngamification on motivation further.",
        "A larger amount of par-\nticipants also allows to have a control group without any game\nelements throughout the study.",
        "We decided against a control\ngroup in this work as we wanted to investigate whether the\nnumber of solved microtasks increases with gamification for\neach subject, which demands a within-subject design, espe-\ncially considering our low participant count.",
        "CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper we investigated a crowd-based approach to en-\nhance the outcome of optical character recognition in the do-\nmain of receipt capturing to keep track of expenses.",
        "We de-\nveloped a prototype which made it possible to track expenses\nby taking photos of receipts and not only recognizes enti-\nties, but also enhances them with semantic information.",
        "At\nthe same time the presented system does not rely on exter-\nnal crowdsourcing platforms (e.g.",
        "Amazon Mechanical Turk)\nbut is able to run in a self-sustained manner without using\nmonetary incentives.",
        "We based our approach on an online\nquestionnaire to gain information about participants shop-\nping behavior, their interest in keeping track of expenses and\ntheir attitude towards automatic receipt capturing, as well as\non a receipt analysis to obtain insights about technical chal-\nlenges in this field.",
        "In a three-week-long user study, we were\nable to show that our approach was appreciated by the users\nand eases keeping track of expenses subjectively.",
        "This miti-\ngates the main reason for not keeping track of expenses: the\nhigh effort involved.",
        "Moreover, we found evidence that gamification provided ad-\nditional motivation to users to contribute more, solve a higher\namount of microtasks and thereby enrich the database.",
        "In future work we plan to investigate the long-term effects of\nour approach to test in how far the error-rate further decreases\nwhen accumulating more data and whether gamfication can\nbe used to keep users engaged over a longer timespan.",

        "UbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nUnderstanding My Data, Myself:\nSupporting Self-Reflection with Ubicomp Technologies\n\nIan Li’, Anind K. Dey’, Jodi Forlizzi'”\n'Human Computer Interaction Institute, “School of Design\nCarnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213\nianli@cmu.edu, {anind, forlizzi}@cs.cmu.edu\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe live in a world where many kinds of data about us can\nbe collected and more will be collected as Ubicomp\ntechnologies mature.",
        "UbiComp’11, September 17-21, 2011, Beijing, China.",
        "Copyright 2011 ACM 978-1-4503-0630-0/11/09...$10.00.",
        "The model also highlights that the\n\n406\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nstages are inter-related, i.e., problems from the earlier\nstages affect the later stages.",
        "Thus, the\nsupport that Ubicomp technologies can provide in\nimproving how data is collected and in increasing the types\nof data that can be collected can help with self-reflection.",
        "Related to the PI model is the Transtheoretical Model of\nBehavior Change (TTM) [25], which also consists of five\nstages: Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation,\nAction, and Maintenance.",
        "Unlike the PI model, which\ndescribes the different types of support needed to assist\npersonal informatics activities, the TTM describes people’s\ndifferent levels of motivation and ability to change\nbehavior.",
        "The TTM is used to classify people’s readiness to\nchange behavior, which is useful for tailoring interventions,\nsuch as, designing feedback to encourage environmentally\nfriendly behavior [13].",
        "Others have also explored other\nbehavioral theories.",
        "Consolvo and colleagues used various\npsychological theories to describe eight design strategies to\nsupport behavior change [6].",
        "Froehlich and colleagues\ndescribed different ways of designing eco-feedback\ntechnologies [10].",
        "While these models suggest the need for\nUbicomp technologies, they do not define how tools should\nbe designed based on people’s changing information needs\nwhen engaging in personal informatics activities.",
        "There is plenty of research on effective information\nvisualization techniques to explore data for insights [see 4\nfor an extensive review], but they are not all focused on\npersonal data.",
        "407\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe transcribed the interview recordings.",
        "For some kinds of data, participants did not use a device to\nmeasure their current status; instead, they used their own\n\n408\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nsenses.",
        "We found that people use personal informatics tools\nto help them set and complete program-level goals.",
        "For\nexample, P4 used SparkPeople because she wanted to\nbecome physically fit (principle-level goal), but the value of\nthe tool was in helping her track her progress in\naccomplishing her program-level goals: running three times\nper week and eating within a specified amount of calories.",
        "She still\n\n409\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\ntracks her blood sugar level, but she just takes mental notes\nof the meal, physical activity, and sleep quality prior to her\nblood sugar level measurement.",
        "Using different\n\n410\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\ntools for different types of data exacerbated this problem.",
        "Several participants who were in the Maintenance phase at\nthe time of the interviews were in the Discovery phase\n\n411\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nearlier in their self-tracking regimen.",
        "During the other times you were active, you\ndecided to walk your dog around the neighborhood.”\n\n412\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nSupporting the Discovery Phase\n\nThere are many opportunities for support in the Discovery\nphase because 1) there are many questions that are asked\nduring this phase; 2) some questions require data collected\nover a long time; and 3) some questions can be answered\nusing multiple types of data.",
        "413\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nHelp users transition from Discovery to Maintenance quickly\nThe Discovery phase is data intensive and can be\nburdensome to users.",

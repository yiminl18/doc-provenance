Dey’, Jodi Forlizzi'”\n'Human Computer Interaction Institute, “School of Design\nCarnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213\nianli@cmu.edu, {anind, forlizzi}@cs.cmu.edu\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe live in a world where many kinds of data about us can\nbe collected and more will be collected as Ubicomp\ntechnologies mature.",
        "People reflect on this data using\ndifferent tools for personal informatics.",
        "However, current\ntools do not have sufficient understanding of users’ self-\nreflection needs to appropriately leverage Ubicomp\ntechnologies.",
        "To design tools that effectively assist self-\nreflection, we need to comprehensively understand what\nkinds of questions people have about their data, why they\nask these questions, how they answer them with current\ntools, and what kinds of problems they encounter.",
        "To\nexplore this, we conducted interviews with people who use\nvarious kinds of tools for personal informatics.",
        "We found\nsix kinds of questions that people asked about their data.",
        "We also found that certain kinds of questions are more\nimportant at certain times, which we call phases.",
        "We\nidentified two phases of reflection: Discovery and\nMaintenance.",
        "We discuss the kinds of questions and the\nphases in detail and identify features that should be\nsupported in personal informatics tools for which Ubicomp\ntechnologies can play an important role.",
        "Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI):\nMiscellaneous.",
        "General Terms\nDesign, Human Factors\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe abundance of computers, mobile devices, sensors, and\naccess to information via the Internet enables the recording\nof a myriad of personal data (e.g., physiological data,\nbehaviors, habits, and thoughts).",
        "All of this data can be\nused for self-reflection to help people become more aware\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.",

        "UbiComp’11, September 17-21, 2011, Beijing, China.",
        "More tools are being developed that\npeople use for personal informatics, which help people\ncollect and reflect on personally relevant data for the\npurpose of self-knowledge [17].",
        "Many Ubicomp tools have\nbeen created for personal informatics, such as Fish'n'Steps\n[18], Ubigreen [10], and mobile apps for diabetes [24].",
        "However, we believe current tools for personal informatics\nwere not designed with sufficient understanding of users’\nself-reflection needs.",
        "For example, a tool might show the\nuser’s current step counts, but the user might prefer a\nhistorical view of her average step counts to inform her how\nto increase her steps.",
        "To appropriately design these tools,\nwe need a comprehensive understanding of what kinds of\nquestions people want to answer about their data, why they\nask these questions, how they answer them with current\ntools, and what kinds of problems they encounter.",
        "By doing\nso, developers and designers can better take advantage of\nUbicomp technologies to help users self-reflect.",
        "To explore these issues, we conducted a study in which we\ninterviewed people who used tools for personal informatics.",
        "We identified six kinds of questions that people asked about\ntheir data: Status, History, Goals, Discrepancies, Context,\nand Factors.",
        "We discuss the tools that people used to\nanswer these kinds of questions and the problems that they\nencountered.",
        "We also discovered that people’s information\nneeds change, which we called phases of reflection:\nDiscovery and Maintenance.",
        "These phases differ by how\nfrequently people asked the different kinds of questions.",
        "An\nimportant aspect of the phases is that people transitioned\nbetween them.",
        "People transitioned from Maintenance to\nDiscovery when they were unable to reach their goals or\nwhen they had to redefine their goals because they\nexperienced a new set of problems.",
        "On the other hand,\npeople transitioned from Discovery to Maintenance when\nthey had identified their goal and had learned the steps they\nneeded to take to achieve their goal.",
        "The importance of this work to Ubicomp is threefold.",
        "First,\nthis work describes the kinds of questions that people ask\nabout their data, which suggests how data should be\npresented to inform users of proper actions towards\nbehavior change.",
        "information they need to make better decisions towards\nbehavior change.",
        "Lastly, this work describes how Ubicomp\ntechnologies can appropriately support people to answer the\nquestions they ask within the phases and help them\ntransition between the phases.",
        "This work shows that\nUbicomp technologies can play an important role in helping\npeople become more self-aware, which is valuable in\nmaking good decisions and changing behavior.",
        "First, we\ndiscuss what we mean by personal informatics and discuss\nrelated work in personal informatics.",
        "Second, we describe\nour interviews, which explore what questions people ask\nabout their data and how they answer these questions with\ncurrent tools.",
        "We then discuss our findings: the six main\nquestions people asked about their data and the two phases\nof reflection that they transitioned between.",
        "We present a\nlist of features that Ubicomp tools should support to help\nusers with reflection, and discuss their implications.",
        "Defining Personal Informatics\n\nWe extend the definition of personal informatics [17] from\na class of tools to an activity where people collect and\nreflect on personal data to gain a better understanding of\ntheir own behavior.",
        "People can and will use almost any tool\nfor personal informatics.",
        "Tools can vary by form factor\n(paper, web sites, devices, etc.)",
        "and level of support\n(manual vs. automated).",
        "However, the limitations of tools\nthat people use can make the activity of personal\ninformatics cumbersome and _ time-consuming [17].",
        "Therefore, Ubicomp technologies have an opportunity to\nassist the people in their personal informatics activity.",
        "Data for personal informatics include data about behavior\n(e.g., frequency of exercise) and physiology (e.g., heart\nrate).",
        "They may include current and historical data and may\nbe quantitative or qualitative (e.g., step counts vs. moods).",
        "In addition to personal information, external data can be\nused when it is personally relevant, e.g., weather data might\nbe personally relevant if the user is interested in knowing\nhow the weather affects her physical activity.",
        "As we will discuss later, our exploration found that people\ncollected personal data for other reasons other than personal\ninformatics, such as reminiscing about the past [21], aiding\nmemory [14], and personal information management [16].",
        "There is much research that shows that reflection plays an\nimportant role in changing behaviors [see 7 for a review].",
        "This paper\nfocuses on supporting users' reflection needs, which is one\nof the stages of the model of personal informatics systems\n[17]: Preparation, Collection, Integration, Reflection, and\nAction.",
        "The model describes the different types of support\nthat tools must provide to assist users through their personal\ninformatics activity.",
        "The model also highlights that the\n\n406\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nstages are inter-related, i.e., problems from the earlier\nstages affect the later stages.",
        "This implies that the person's\nability to reflect on her data and the value of the reflection\nare affected by how and what data she collects.",
        "Thus, the\nsupport that Ubicomp technologies can provide in\nimproving how data is collected and in increasing the types\nof data that can be collected can help with self-reflection.",
        "Related to the PI model is the Transtheoretical Model of\nBehavior Change (TTM) [25], which also consists of five\nstages: Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation,\nAction, and Maintenance.",
        "Unlike the PI model, which\ndescribes the different types of support needed to assist\npersonal informatics activities, the TTM describes people’s\ndifferent levels of motivation and ability to change\nbehavior.",
        "The TTM is used to classify people’s readiness to\nchange behavior, which is useful for tailoring interventions,\nsuch as, designing feedback to encourage environmentally\nfriendly behavior [13].",
        "Froehlich and colleagues\ndescribed different ways of designing eco-feedback\ntechnologies [10].",
        "While these models suggest the need for\nUbicomp technologies, they do not define how tools should\nbe designed based on people’s changing information needs\nwhen engaging in personal informatics activities.",
        "There is plenty of research on effective information\nvisualization techniques to explore data for insights [see 4\nfor an extensive review], but they are not all focused on\npersonal data.",
        "Some projects have applied exploration\ntechniques on personal data.",
        "For example, Frost and Smith\nused visualizations to help diabetic patients explore the\nrelationship between their blood glucose level and the types\nof food they consumed [11].",
        "Commercial products, such as\nMint (expenditures), Nike+ (physical activity), and Wattson\n(electricity), use information visualizations to assist users in\nexploring their data for patterns and trends.",
        "Some\ninformation visualizations, such as ambient displays [22],\nglanceable displays [19], and information art [20], are less\nfocused on exploration of historical information.",
        "Instead,\nthey increase awareness of one’s current status (e.g., you’ve\ngot mail, your stock portfolio is currently up, your bus is\narriving) while minimizing cognitive load.",
        "We use this exploration to define users’ specific\ninformation needs and to describe how Ubicomp\ntechnologies can provide support.",
        "In the next section, we describe our interviews of people\nwho used tools for personal informatics.",
        "We analyzed the\nresponses for the kinds of questions they asked and how\nthey used existing tools to answer them.",
        "INTERVIEWS\nThe goal of the interviews was to study how people explore\nand reflect on the data they collect for personal informatics.",
        "We conducted interviews with people who were already\nself-tracking and reflecting on collected data.",
        "This helped\nus see behavior in a natural setting where people’s routines\naround tracking and reflecting were focused on their own\nneeds, rather than forcing people to use a system we\ndesigned.",
        "In the following sections, we describe how we\nrecruited participants and conducted the interviews.",
        "Recruitment\n\nWe advertised the study on Craigslist, the Quantified Self\nblog, and a campus recruiting web site.",
        "The recruitment\nletter stated that we were looking for users of self-\ntracking/personal informatics tools, such as Mint, Nike+,\nMoodJam, etc.",
        "People interested in the study completed a\npre-questionnaire that asked what type of data they collect,\nfor how long, and contact information.",
        "They had to be\ncurrently using a tool for personal informatics and must\nhave used it for a month or more.",
        "We recruited a diverse\ngroup of people from around the nation and our city.",
        "Given\nthat we were only going to be able to talk to a limited\nnumber of people, the pre-questionnaire helped us ensure\nthat we recruited a set of participants using a range of tools\nfor a range of types of data.",
        "91 people responded to the pre-questionnaire (local: 76,\nremote: 15).",
        "We selected 15 people (P1-P15) from all the\nrespondents to participate in the study.",
        "Ten lived locally\nwithin the city limits and five lived remotely.",
        "A third were\nmale (5 vs. 10 females).",
        "The age ranges and their respective\ncounts were 20-25 (6), 25-30 (4), 30-35 (1), and over 50\n(4).",
        "Additionally, half were professionals (8) and the rest\nwere students (graduate: 4, undergraduate: 3).",
        "Procedure\n\nWe invited participants for a one-hour interview in either\nour lab or over Skype, depending on whether they lived\nlocally or remotely.",
        "Local participants were required to\nbring the tools they used for personal informatics (e.g.,\nlaptop, devices, notebooks) to the interview.",
        "Remote\nparticipants used Skype's Screen Sharing and Video\nfeatures to show us the tools they used.",
        "At the beginning of the interview, we introduced\nparticipants to the study.",
        "Participants signed the study\nconsent form and completed an online survey that asked\nabout their general personal informatics usage.",
        "The\nquestionnaire is a condensed version of the survey\ndescribed in [17].",
        "We sat with the participants in front of\ntheir laptop or mobile phone and asked them to describe\ntheir general usage.",
        "We observed participants as they used\ntheir tools.",
        "We asked them how they reflected on their data\nand to show us how they reviewed their data: What were\nthey looking for?",
        "What questions did they have?",
        "Why did\nthey ask these questions?",
        "How did they answer their\nquestions using their tools?",
        "What problems did they\nexperience while trying to answer their questions?",
        "Participants were compensated $10 (in cash or as Amazon\ngift certificates) for the one hour they spent with us.",
        "The\ninterviews were videotaped.",
        "407\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe transcribed the interview recordings.",
        "We analyzed the\ninterviews by coding the responses line by line.",
        "We did not\nhave a pre-determined coding scheme before the analysis.",
        "Instead, we identified themes from the data as we processed\nthe responses.",
        "The themes emerged after we organized the\ncodes using affinity diagrams.",
        "During the analysis, we\nfocused on the reasons people reflected on their data, what\nquestions people were trying to answer when reflecting on\ntheir data, how the tools they used supported or prevented\nfinding answers to their questions), and what design\nfeatures in the tools they used supported their personal\ninformatics activity.",
        "Participant Information\n\nTo help focus our interviews, we asked participants to\ndescribe the primary data about themselves that they\ncollected [Table 1].",
        "The participants varied in the types of\ninformation they collected.",
        "The primary data that\nparticipants collected were: financial expenditures (3), sleep\n(3), weight (2), blood glucose level (2), exercise (1),\nproductivity (1), web history (1), books read (1), and life\nevents (1).",
        "Half of the participants collected one or more\ntypes of data.",
        "For example, P7, who collected the widest\nvariety of data, used Daytum and your.flowingdata to track\ntelevision shows and movies that she watched, restaurants\nshe dined at, and places she visited.",
        "She recorded her eating\nhabits with DailyBurn.",
        "Because of periods of insomnia, she\nused Fitbit to record her sleep patterns and physical activity\nlevels.",
        "She also complemented her sleep tracking by taking\nnotes about the quality of her sleep in YawnLog.",
        "There was\nalso a diversity of experiences in self-tracking.",
        "Four\nparticipants had been self-tracking for a month or two;\nseven participants, for a year or two; and three participants,\nfor more than three years.",
        "P3, who has diabetes, had been\ntracking her blood glucose level for 15 years.",
        "For several\nyears, she used a fingerstick blood glucose meter that\nrequired piercing the skin to draw blood 3 to 10 times a\nday.",
        "In the past year, she started using a Dexcom device,\nwhich has a sensor that adheres to the body and\ncontinuously takes blood glucose readings very 5 minutes.",
        "ID Primary Data Multiple Types?",
        "Reason\n\nP1 expenses No Behavior Change\nP2 weight Yes Behavior Change\nP3 blood glucose Was Behavior Change\nP4 exercise Was Behavior Change\nP5 expenses Yes Behavior Change\nP6 blood glucose Was Behavior Change\nP7 sleep Was Behavior Change\nP8 sleep Yes Behavior Change\nP9 sleep Yes Behavior Change\nP10 life events No Reminiscence\nP11 weight Was Behavior Change\nP12 expenses No Coordination\n\nP13 productivity No Behavior Change\nP14 web history No Retrieval\n\nP15 books No Sharing\n\nTable 1.",
        "Reasons\n\nParticipants cited different reasons for collecting personal\ndata.",
        "Many participants (11 out of 15) self-tracked to reflect\non the data, because they wanted to change or maintain a\nbehavior.",
        "For example, P1 used Mint to maintain a budget\nafter moving to a new city.",
        "P8 tracked her sleep patterns\nand various factors that might affect the quality of her sleep\nusing the Sleeptracker watch and laptop application.",
        "Four\nparticipants collected data for other uses.",
        "P14 collected his\nweb history with Google Web History for /ater retrieval.",
        "P15 collected book information in GoodReads to share with\nother people.",
        "P12 recorded his grocery and_ utility\nexpenditures in Buxfer to easily coordinate expenses with\nhis roommates.",
        "P10 wrote about life events in online\njournals to better remember her past.",
        "These four\nparticipants’ usage of personal informatics tools is more\nclosely in line with other types of applications (in order):\npersonal information management, social networking,\ncoordination, and reminiscence.",
        "In the following section,\nwe focus our discussion on the 11 participants who wanted\nto change or maintain their behavior, because personal\ninformatics tools are useful when they help people gain\nself-knowledge that improves decision-making and assists\nin behavior change.",
        "QUESTIONS\n\nIn this section, we discuss the 6 kinds of questions that\npeople asked about their personal information: Status,\nHistory, Goals, Discrepancies, Context, and Factors.",
        "We\ndescribe in detail what participants were looking for and\nhow they answered their questions.",
        "Status\n\nPeople were interested in data that revealed their current\nstatus.",
        "For example, P7 checked her Fitbit device several\ntimes a day to determine her current physical activity level.",
        "Checking one’s status doesn’t have to happen several times\na day; P5 checked her finances using Mint and her bank\nweb site at the end of each day.",
        "People also checked their current status to determine\nwhether they were meeting their goal and whether they\nshould act to correct their behavior.",
        "For example, P7\nchecked her step count to determine whether she took\nenough steps for the day.",
        "If not, she would go out for a\nwalk.",
        "P5 checked her finances to make sure that she is\nstaying within her daily budget.",
        "If not, she tried to spend\nless the subsequent days.",
        "How often people checked their status is dependent on what\nkind of data they were tracking and how they were tracking\nit.",
        "For example, P3 and P6 have diabetes, and used blood\nglucose meters to measure their current blood sugar level.",
        "P3 wore a Dexcom continuous blood glucose meter, which\nmeasured her blood glucose level every 5 minutes.",
        "However, P6 used a fingerstick device, so he could only\ncheck 3 to 6 times a day.",
        "For some kinds of data, participants did not use a device to\nmeasure their current status; instead, they used their own\n\n408\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nsenses.",
        "For example, P9 who was interested in her sleep\nquality recorded the quality of her sleep and whether leg\ncramps occurred.",
        "P8 used the SleepTracker watch to\nmeasure her sleep, but she used her senses to record\ninformation related to sleep, such as mood and stress.",
        "History\n\nBeyond looking at one’s current status, participants were\nalso interested in seeing their data over the long term.",
        "Instead of looking at one piece of data or a short time’s\nworth of data (an hour to a day), people wanted to see their\ndata over a long range to find trends and patterns.",
        "Trends\n(whether the data is going up, going down, or remaining\nsteady) are especially important to figure out whether they\nare making progress towards a particular goal.",
        "For example,\nP4 looked for trends in her physical activity data to make\nsure that she was maintaining her goal of regular physical\nactivity over a long period of time.",
        "P5 also looked at trends\nto make sure that she was reducing her monthly\nexpenditures to save for a trip abroad.",
        "People experienced different kinds of problems in\nunderstanding their history.",
        "One problem is that the ability\nto see trends and patterns largely depends on having\ncollected data over a long period of time.",
        "Thus, the person\nhas to first put in the effort of collecting data before the\nvalue of the data becomes evident.",
        "For example, P5 started\nusing Mint when her mom introduced her to the site.",
        "She\ncould not make any significant conclusions regarding her\nspending trends because she had only been collecting data\nfor a month prior to the interview.",
        "Another problem is that\ntools do not provide adequate support to allow reflection\nover the long term.",
        "P8 experienced this problem with the\nSleepTracker watch, which she had been using for several\nmonths.",
        "The watch had a desktop interface to review her\npast history.",
        "However, the software just listed her sleep\nquantity on a spreadsheet-like interface, which made it\ndifficult to see trends.",
        "She said a simple bar graph would\nhave been helpful.",
        "A related question is: how does data from one time range\ncompare with another?",
        "Viewing one's data over a long\nperiod of time allows the person to answer this question.",
        "For example, Pl compared her spending between two\ndifferent months.",
        "She was particularly interested in seeing\nhow her recent move affected her spending.",
        "Goal\n\nIn addition to wanting to know their status and their history,\npeople also wanted to figure out what goals would be\nappropriate to pursue.",
        "Sometimes, people started self-\ntracking without knowing their goal and they used self-\ntracking as way to 1) determine what actions they should\ntake to fix a problem or 2) establish a “baseline” of their\nactivities to determine whether they have a problem.",
        "Before we go into detail about this question, we need to\ndefine what kind of goals we are talking about, because the\ndistinction between the different kinds of goals is\nimportant.",
        "structure ranging from abstract to more specific.",
        "The four\nlevels are system concept, principle, program, and\nsequence.",
        "The system-concept goal refers to the sense of an\nidealized self, an idealized relationship, or an idealized\nsociety, and, as such, is very abstract.",
        "The next level of\ngoals is the principle level, which refers to the set of goals\n(or guiding principles) that one tries to achieve to reach an\nideal.",
        "Some examples of principle-level goals are: be\nphysically fit, be thrifty, and be productive.",
        "This level is\nstill quite abstract; a person does not just become physically\nfit or thrifty or productive, one has to exhibit such qualities\nby doing specific activities or programs [26].",
        "Some\nexample of program-level goals are: 1) running three times\na week to become physically fit; 2) spending money within\na budget to become thrifty; and 3) minimizing the amount\nof time spent browsing social media websites to become\nproductive.",
        "To perform a program-level goal, a person does\nsequences of specific actions.",
        "For example, the sequence-\nlevel goals to complete the goal of running three times a\nweek may consist of putting on shoes, going outside,\nrunning a specified route, etc.",
        "In the rest of this paper, we are talking about “program-\nlevel goals” when we refer to “goals”.",
        "Program-level goals\nare more specific than principle- or system-concept level\ngoals, so they are more actionable or more ready to be acted\nupon.",
        "We found that people use personal informatics tools\nto help them set and complete program-level goals.",
        "For\nexample, P4 used SparkPeople because she wanted to\nbecome physically fit (principle-level goal), but the value of\nthe tool was in helping her track her progress in\naccomplishing her program-level goals: running three times\nper week and eating within a specified amount of calories.",
        "Knowing one’s goals had an effect on the number of kinds\nof data the participants collected.",
        "For example, P9 had\nproblems sleeping because of her leg cramps.",
        "She wanted to\naddress the problem to improve her sleep (principle-level\ngoal), but she did not know what caused her leg cramps.",
        "She tracked what she ate and her physical activity to see if\nthese were causing the leg cramps, so she could make\nprogram-level goals, such as “avoid X kind of food” or\n“don’t do physical activity X hours before sleeping.”\n\nOnce participants identified their program-level goals, they\nchanged their data collection habits.",
        "For example, when P3\nwas diagnosed with diabetes, she did not know the\nappropriate program-level goals to manage her diabetes,\nsuch as what specific foods to avoid, how active she could\nbe, etc.",
        "To figure out her goals, she collected multiple kinds\nof data: what she ate, what physical activity she did, as well\nas her blood sugar level.",
        "She is a “brittle diabetic” (her\nblood sugar fluctuates to dangerous levels quickly), so\nfiguring out the effects of food and physical activity was\ncritical, but difficult to do.",
        "She did this for two years until\nshe understood her blood sugar fluctuations better and she\nwas able to set appropriate food and physical activity goals.",
        "When this happened, she stopped collecting the other pieces\nof data because she already knew their effects.",
        "She still\n\n409\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\ntracks her blood sugar level, but she just takes mental notes\nof the meal, physical activity, and sleep quality prior to her\nblood sugar level measurement.",
        "Discrepancies\n\nOnce people know their goal, they compare their current\nstatus with their goal [5].",
        "We also observed this in our\ninterviews.",
        "Participants checked their current status then\ncompared it with their goal: Is there a difference between\nmy current status and my goal?",
        "How big is the difference?",
        "And what should I do to reduce the difference?",
        "For\nexample, P4 wanted to become more physically active, so\nshe set a goal of exercising every other day or about three\ntimes a week.",
        "She looked at her weekly physical activity\nusing SparkPeople.",
        "She checked how much her current\nstatus differed from the goal.",
        "When she found a difference,\nshe modified her schedule to compensate for her missed\nphysical activity.",
        "Also, how participants addressed\ndiscrepancies changed over time.",
        "At the beginning, P4 was\nvery strict at meeting her goals, so she immediately\naddressed missing her goal by exercising the same day.",
        "A\nyear after her physical activity tracking she became less\nstrict about meeting her goal.",
        "She allowed herself to miss\ndays, and instead of exercising immediately, she postponed\nphysical activity until the end of the week when she had\nmore time.",
        "Another example is P11 who compared her\ndaily food consumption with a range of calories, a goal that\nshe had set in the DailyPlate tool.",
        "Every day she checked\nwhether she was within the range of her allotted daily\nconsumption.",
        "When her consumption was below her goal,\nshe increased her consumption for that day.",
        "If she was\nwithin range, she made sure that she did not go over.",
        "Both\nP4 and P11 found that comparing their current status with\ntheir goal helped them make immediate decisions to address\nany differences.",
        "If they were meeting their goal, they could\nfocus on maintaining it.",
        "A problem with this question is that it is largely dependent\non knowing what the program-level goal is.",
        "If the goal is\nundefined, the person cannot act on fixing their problem.",
        "This is what happened with P9.",
        "She knew her principle-\nlevel goal: fix her leg cramps when she goes to sleep.",
        "Unfortunately, she did not understand the causes of her leg\ncramps well enough to set appropriate program-level goals,\nsuch as avoiding certain foods or certain physical activity.",
        "Context\n\nParticipants also wondered what other things were\nhappening at or near the same time as their current\ninformation-seeking context.",
        "They were curious about how\nother events may explain what was happening to them in\nthe present.",
        "For example, P3 kept in mind other events at or\nnear the time she checked her blood sugar level (e.g., what\nshe ate, what physical activity she did), so she could act on\nproblems appropriately.",
        "P6 noted his current mood and\nstress level along with his blood sugar level.",
        "He thought\nthat his blood sugar level might explain how he was feeling.",
        "How participants answered this question was dependent on\ntheir access to additional data.",
        "other devices.",
        "For example, P6 used Fitbit and Zeo to\nautomatically record his physical activity and sleep quality.",
        "He used the data from these devices to figure out the\nrelationship of his physical activity and sleep with his blood\nsugar level.",
        "Some people used written notes (on paper or a\nweb site) to remind themselves of other events that\nhappened at a particular time.",
        "P8 used the annotation\nfeature in the SleepTracker software to record her mood,\nstress level, and caffeine intake, which may be related to\nher sleep quality.",
        "PS kept a journal of her activities to\nremind her of what she did when she spent her money.",
        "Sometimes, people just depended on their memory to\nremind them of what happened.",
        "For example, P4 diligently\nrecorded her data at the start of her self-tracking, but after a\nwhile she just used her memory.",
        "She explained, “I just\ndepend on my memory...I didn’t want to become, like,\nOCD (obsessive-compulsive) about it.’ However, one\nproblem with dependence on memory is that one's memory\nof events can be unreliable and degrades over time.",
        "Factors\n\nUnlike the previous question, which asks what influences a\nperson’s current status, this question asks what influences\nbehavior over a long period of time.",
        "Factors collected over\ntime help to identify and monitor trends.",
        "For example, P4\nwas curious how her physical activity and nutrition affected\nher overall health over a long period of time.",
        "Participants were interested in how other factors may be\naffecting their behavior.",
        "For example, it is not sufficient to\nsay that one wants to lose weight; it is important to know\nhow one’s physical activity level and food consumption\naffect one’s weight.",
        "By knowing the factors, people can act\non those factors to change their behavior.",
        "This is especially\nimportant when other things could cause the behavior.",
        "For\nexample, P2 was interested in losing weight.",
        "To help her\naccomplish this goal, she tracked several types of\ninformation in addition to her weight: exercises she did,\nwhat she ate, total calories, and water drank.",
        "She used the\nCalorieTracker Android app to help her compute the\ncalories of her food and DailyPlate to store all the data\nonline.",
        "She used the DailyPlate graphs and charts to see the\ntrends in her weight and how they were affected by other\nfactors.",
        "When her weight went up, she reduced her food\nintake and increased her physical activity.",
        "She also made\nsure that her weight went down at a “healthy rate of\ndecline”, so that she lost weight in a healthy way.",
        "P2 also\nwrote in a journal to record her goals and how she felt about\nher progress.",
        "She said, “I look for things that I have done\nwell.",
        "Places where I might have made a misstep, either I’ve\ndone too much exercise in one day or I’ve done too little.",
        "Or maybe I didn’t meet all of my exchanges or maybe I met\nall of my exchanges, calorie-wise.”\n\nOne problem with this kind of question is that a tool did not\nexist that could help users explore their data holistically.",
        "Instead, they had to look at their data one at a time.",
        "Even\nwhen data was stored in the same tool, they had to look at\ndifferent graphs separately (e.g., Daytum).",
        "Using different\n\n410\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\ntools for different types of data exacerbated this problem.",
        "For example, P6 used Fitbit for physical activity and Zeo\nfor sleep and there was not an easy way to look at these\ndata together.",
        "P7 used Fitbit for both sleep and physical\nactivity tracking, so she was able to explore both types of\ndata together.",
        "However, she also collected other types of\ndata using Daytum and your.flowingdata, which she could\nnot easily review along with her Fitbit data.",
        "Some\nparticipants managed to explore their data together by using\npaper graphs (P9 and P6) or by painstakingly reviewing\nlogs of their data (P2 and P8).",
        "However, participants\nexperienced other setbacks: exploring multiple types of data\nwas confusing and understanding the influences of the\nfactors on their behavior was difficult.",
        "PHASES OF REFLECTION\n\nWe noticed that participants asked some questions more\noften than others at different times.",
        "We analyzed our data\nfurther by looking at when participants asked certain\nquestions.",
        "We identified two distinct phases when\nparticipants asked different sets of questions: Maintenance\nand Discovery.",
        "We also found that participants did not\nremain in one phase; instead they transitioned between the\ntwo.",
        "We discuss the properties of each phase and the\ntransitions between the phases in the next sections.",
        "Maintenance Phase\n\nThe Maintenance phase is marked with participants mostly\nasking Status and Discrepancy questions.",
        "In this phase,\nparticipants used their collected data to maintain awareness\nof their status relative to a goal and to maintain their\nbehavior.",
        "When in the Maintenance phase, participants can\nbe characterized in the following way: 1) they already knew\nthe goal they were trying to meet and 2) they have\nidentified how different factors affected their behavior.",
        "We\ndescribe each of these characteristics below.",
        "Participants in the Maintenance phase have already\nidentified their program-level goals.",
        "In this phase, they self-\ntrack to determine whether their current actions are in line\nwith their goals.",
        "P13 wanted to be more productive\n(principle-level goal), and had already determined his\nprogram-level goal: limit his visits to social media websites\nto 20 minutes a day.",
        "While his StayFocusd Chrome browser\nextension stored his total web site visit times over a week\nand a month, he did not look at those numbers; he just\nneeded the tool to alert him when he went above his goal.",
        "P1 used Mint to keep track of her expenditures to make sure\nthat she is meeting several budgets that she had already set\nfor various categories of expenditures (program-level\ngoals).",
        "When she showed us her Mint account, she had set\nbudgets for 14 categories!",
        "Also, participants in the Maintenance phase already knew\nthe relationships between their behavior and factors that\naffect their behavior.",
        "They collected information about their\nbehavior; they did not collect other types of data that might\naffect their behavior because they were not useful anymore.",
        "For example, P13 just tracked the minutes that he spent on\nFacebook, Twitter, and other social media sites, because he\n\n\nPaper Session: How Healthy?",
        "already knew how browsing such web sites affected his\nproductivity.",
        "He did not track other factors that might affect\nhis productivity (e.g., sleep quality, interruptions).",
        "P1 did\nnot use the exploratory tools within Mint to see how much\nshe had spent on different categories and what she\npurchased.",
        "Instead, she primarily used the main screen\nwhere her budget was prominently displayed to check\nwhether she was within her monthly budget.",
        "During the Maintenance phase, participants only tracked\none or a few types of data.",
        "They have already defined their\ngoal and were collecting just enough information that\nwould allow them to tell whether they were meeting their\ngoal.",
        "For example, Pl and P5 only reflected on their\nexpenses and P13, on his productivity.",
        "Discovery Phase\n\nThe Discovery phase is marked with participants mostly\nasking History, Goals, Context, and Factors questions.",
        "When in the Discovery phase, participants can be\ncharacterized in the following way: 1) they did not know\nthe goal they were trying to meet and/or 2) they have not\nidentified the factors that influenced their behavior.",
        "We\ndescribe each of these characteristics below.",
        "Participants in the Discovery phase were still trying to\nfigure out what their program-level goals were.",
        "When P3\nwas newly diagnosed with diabetes, she knew that she had\nto manage her blood sugar level (principle-level goal), but\nshe did not know specifically what kinds of foods to avoid\nor how much physical activity she could perform (program-\nlevel goals).",
        "P8 tracked the quality of her sleep so that she\nfeels better rested (principle-level goal).",
        "She explored her\nsleep data to “spot trends for which I can take corrective\naction.” She wanted to figure out the specific program-level\ngoals that would improve her sleep quality, such as eating\ndinner earlier or refraining from coffee or alcohol.",
        "She also\nadded that she was “trying to take a long-term view”, so\nthat the solution is “not a quick-fix approach.”\n\nAlso, participants in the Discovery phase did not know how\ndifferent factors affected their behavior.",
        "Because of this\nlack of knowledge, participants collected different types of\ndata, so they could figure out the correlations between\nthem.",
        "P3 tracked food consumption and physical activity\nalong with her blood glucose levels because she wanted to\nfigure out how her eating and exercise habits affected the\nfluctuations in her blood glucose level.",
        "P9 had leg cramps\nwhile sleeping.",
        "She had several hypotheses about what\ncaused her leg cramps.",
        "She talked to her doctor who said\nthe leg cramps might be due to an electrolyte imbalance, so\nshe tracked the types of food she ate.",
        "She also used FitBit to\nsee if her amount of physical activity had an effect on the\noccurrence of her leg cramps.",
        "Transitions Between Phases\n\nWe found in our interviews that people did not stay in one\nphase; instead, they transitioned between the two phases.",
        "Several participants who were in the Maintenance phase at\nthe time of the interviews were in the Discovery phase\n\n411\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nearlier in their self-tracking regimen.",
        "P6 initially tracked his\nblood sugar level, his food consumption, and mood until he\nfound that “it turns out one of the things I do to manage\nstress is eat something, because blood sugar feels good.",
        "So\nif things are unsettled or high pressure, eating something\nfeels good.” P6 described his transition to gaining control of\nhis diabetes, “In the initial phase, three and a half years ago,\nover about six months, I learned to control my blood sugar\ndown to a level from 300 to about 180.",
        "Then I escaped\nthere and measurement became less interesting because\nthere was no progress to be made; it was steady state stuff.”\nP3 had a similar experience in dealing with her diabetes.",
        "She said, “When I first became diabetic, I needed to keep\ntrack of everything.",
        "At this point in my life, I've had\ndiabetes for about 15 years, and I no longer write anything\ndown.” Now, she just wears a continuous blood glucose\nmonitoring device to alert her whether her blood glucose is\ntoo high or too low.",
        "Her reason for transitioning was two-\nfold: 1) tracking all the information “would be onerous”\nand 2) “it wasn’t helping me anymore.",
        "I was remembering.",
        "Not the exact numbers, but I was remembering trends.”\n\nP4 tracked her physical activity and food consumption\ndiligently at the beginning, but became more lax later and\ndid not track her food consumption.",
        "She said, “I feel like I\nhave a handle on it.",
        "I have accomplished the goals of\ncreating a healthy lifestyle for myself.",
        "As long as I stay like\nthis I'm good.",
        "It's more maintenance.” She still kept track of\nher physical activity, but for her food tracking, she just\n“keeps a mental note of it and just overall have become\nmore self aware of what I eat and stuff.”\n\nSometimes people have difficulty transitioning to the\nMaintenance phase because they could not find an\nactionable goal.",
        "P9 described that she still did not know\nwhat caused the leg cramps when she sleeps.",
        "She said,\n“They’re not completely gone, but they’re not as bad as\nthey were.",
        "But I still don’t know exactly what’s caused\nthem.” She added that she still recorded the recurrence of\nthe leg cramps, “It may always be sort of a mystery, and so\nI still have data for every night I’ve had leg cramps.”\n\nAll the participants who were in the Maintenance phase at\nthe time of the study described anecdotes when they might\ngo back to the Discovery phase.",
        "For example, while looking\nat her budget, P1 saw that she made a purchase of $24 for a\ngift and she asked herself, “What was that?” She said since\nshe did not remember, she explored her data to find an\nexplanation.",
        "Since Mint provided enough detail about her\npurchases, she easily found that the gifts were bought at a\nlocal mall, which reminded her that she recently purchased\na gift for a friend there.",
        "Sometimes the explanatory data\nwas not immediately available, so the participant had to\nrestart data collection of influencing factors.",
        "For example,\nP7 who had recurrent insomnia tracked her sleep using\nFitBit.",
        "Patterns of insomnia or weird dreams would appear\nintermittently and she would again note factors that may\nhave caused the problem.",
        "FEATURES\n\nWe have identified the questions that people asked and the\nphases in which people asked these different questions.",
        "Now, we discuss the features that should be supported in\nbuilding personal informatics tools and how Ubicomp\ntechnologies can help.",
        "We also describe opportunities for\nUbicomp to explore.",
        "Supporting the Maintenance Phase\n\nSupporting the Maintenance Phase is not as difficult as the\nDiscovery phase because many personal informatics tools\nalready support collecting the user’s current status.",
        "Additionally, if a Ubicomp technology can sense simple\nthings about a user’s behavior, it is not difficult to display\nthe information back to the user.",
        "However, there are some\nopportunities to better support the Maintenance phase.",
        "Alert the user when they are not meeting their goal\n\nDuring the Maintenance phase, it is possible for a user to\nknow how to fix their problem, but still not fix the problem.",
        "For example, a pedometer user may know that they can get\nplenty of steps while walking their dog at the park, but the\nuser may still not consistently walk their dog.",
        "In cases like\nthis, feedback about progress towards goals can have a\npositive effect on self-efficacy and achievement [27].",
        "Additionally, Ubicomp technologies can help by identifying\nwhether the user is meeting their goal.",
        "Because alerts can\nsometimes be unwelcome, Ubicomp technologies, such as\njust-in-time feedback [15], can help determine the\nopportune time to alert the user of discrepancies.",
        "Participants were more interested in their current status\nduring the Maintenance phase compared to during the\nDiscovery phase.",
        "Most tools for personal informatics have\ndaily reminders of the user’s current status, but this may\nbecome bothersome if the status is the same as the past\nseveral days.",
        "Instead, tools should reserve alerts for when\nspecial circumstances arise (e.g., the user’s step counts\nchanged significantly).",
        "Tools can better support this by\ngiving users control of when they are alerted.",
        "Assist the user when they don't meet their goal\n\nThe phases of reflection do not address the question of how\nusers could act on their newfound insights to change their\nbehavior.",
        "Thus, it is possible for a user in the Maintenance\nphase to still not meet their goal.",
        "When the user does not\nmeet her goal, the tool can be proactive in assisting her in\nresolving the problem.",
        "One idea is to analyze the user’s\nhistory to create suggestions for resolution.",
        "For example, an\nautomated analysis can reveal the causes of the problem.",
        "The tool can say “when you drink coffee at 6pm, you have\na hard time sleeping, so avoid drinking coffee at 6pm”.",
        "Automated analysis can also remind users of what they did\nbefore to resolve the problem.",
        "For example, “last time when\nyou weren’t being active you were sitting on the couch\nwatching TV.",
        "During the other times you were active, you\ndecided to walk your dog around the neighborhood.”\n\n412\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nSupporting the Discovery Phase\n\nThere are many opportunities for support in the Discovery\nphase because 1) there are many questions that are asked\nduring this phase; 2) some questions require data collected\nover a long time; and 3) some questions can be answered\nusing multiple types of data.",
        "Collect data anytime, anywhere, and often\n\nPeople in the Discovery phase try to better understand their\nbehavior by collecting sufficient data to yield insights\nduring reflection.",
        "Getting sufficient data may require\ntracking over a long period of time, over different contexts,\nand with great frequency.",
        "For example, understanding how\none’s environment affects physical activity may require\ntracking over a couple of weeks, at multiple locations,\nthroughout the day.",
        "Many barriers to personal informatics\nare associated the burden of collecting data [17].",
        "Automated data capture as exemplified by many Ubicomp\ntechnologies (e.g., [1,12]) can reduce this burden by\nautomating the data collection and storing large amounts of\ndata about the user.",
        "By reducing the burden of data\ncollection, users can focus on exploring their data.",
        "There is a caveat about user involvement in reflection that\nis important.",
        "In the Discovery phase, user involvement is\ncritical.",
        "People want to discover the relationships between\ndata.",
        "Automation can diminish users’ engagement with\ntheir data.",
        "This does not mean that automation should not\nbe supported.",
        "It just means that automation should be\nbalanced with ways to keep users engaged with their data.",
        "One way to do this is to force users to interact with their\ndata daily, either by sending reports or alerts.",
        "On the other\nhand, user involvement in the Maintenance phase is not as\ncritical.",
        "Users are just trying to maintain their behavior.",
        "Telling people that they are doing well can become\nannoying.",
        "Instead, the Ubicomp tool should be there to\nnotify the user if anything unusual happens.",
        "Support different kinds of collection tools\n\nCorollary to the previously discussed need, understanding\nbehavior may require exploring the relationships between\nmultiple types of data.",
        "For example, understanding how\none’s environment affects physical activity may require\ncollection of multiple types of data, such as location, type\nof activity, and weather.",
        "However, most tools for personal\ninformatics only support collection of one or a few types of\ndata.",
        "One thing to do is to wait for an “ultimate” data\ncollection tool that can collect any kind of the data that a\nuser wants to collect.",
        "However, this might just be a pipe\ndream or could be too far off into the future.",
        "More\nrealistically, users should be allowed to use different kinds\nof collection tools, and then a system or a service can help\nusers integrate data from the different collection tools.",
        "There is a proliferation of APIs available, and we can take\nadvantage of this.",
        "Recently, Fitbit and Zeo partnered with\nRunKeeper to share data with each other.",
        "This is a good\ndevelopment because people can now use different tools to\ncollect data.",
        "However, this is still incomplete because there\nis a plethora of tools that are not interoperable.",
        "interoperability has been part of Ubicomp since Weiser\nstarted the field [29], so the expertise exists in Ubicomp to\nhelp develop and establish standards for interoperation\nbetween self-tracking devices and systems.",
        "Data should be presented together\n\nOne of the consequences of needing multiple types of data\nduring the Discovery phase is that people have to use\ndifferent kinds of tools.",
        "Unfortunately, the current state of\npersonal informatics systems is that they tend to be silos of\ndata, that is, they do not share data with other systems.",
        "When they do share data, they do so in a limited fashion,\nonly supporting a few tools.",
        "One of the many complaints\nthat people had was that they had to go to different\napplications/web sites to answer their questions.",
        "They\nwished that they could explore their data in a single\ninterface.",
        "Again, Ubicomp technologies can help here.",
        "There has been plenty of research in Ubicomp on how to\nintegrate data together [9,12].",
        "The technology is already\navailable to help people collect and see their data from\nmultiple sources at once.",
        "Reduce the upfront cost of data collection\n\nPeople in the Discovery phase are interested in relationships\nbetween different kinds of personal data.",
        "This presents two\nkinds of problems.",
        "First, users have to spend a significant\namount of time collecting data.",
        "One solution is to support\nlifelong automated data collection of personal data, which\nmany Ubicomp research projects are exploring [12,14].",
        "The\nsecond problem is that users cannot predict whether they\nare collecting all of the data they need.",
        "This problem is\ncalled the relevance paradox [2].",
        "For example, people often\ndo not decide to self-track because the data is not important\nto them.",
        "However, when the data becomes important (e.g.,\nthey get sick or they want to develop new habits), they do\nnot have the necessary data to start reflecting immediately.",
        "Thus, they have to invest plenty of upfront cost to bootstrap\ntheir data collection.",
        "With lifelong data collection, once the\nuser needs the data, Ubicomp tools can provide the\nnecessary data for the user to figure out what their goal\nshould be or what factors are influencing their behavior.",
        "Supporting Transitions between Phases\n\nSince people transition between the two phases, personal\ninformatics tools should not be designed for just one phase,\nbut should be flexible to support both.",
        "This is important\nbecause it prevents a potential problem with any personal\ninformatics tool: people may stop using the tool because\ntheir information needs are not appropriately supported.",
        "Identify which phase the user is in\n\nPersonal informatics tools should identify what phase the\nuser is in and change its reflection features appropriately.",
        "Without this support, people might find the tool useless\nbecause of too little information during the Discovery\nphase, or people may be burdened with too much\ninformation during the Maintenance phase.",
        "It is an\ninteresting Ubicomp research challenge to automatically\ndetermine what phase the user is in, based on sensed data.",
        "413\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nHelp users transition from Discovery to Maintenance quickly\nThe Discovery phase is data intensive and can be\nburdensome to users.",
        "Personal informatics tools should help\nusers who are in the Discovery phase to identify program-\nlevel goals and how different factors affect their behavior,\nso users can transition quickly to the Maintenance phase.",
        "This would be interesting future work to explore how\nUbicomp technologies help users understand their data.",
        "Continuous data collection throughout the phases\n\nThe amount of data that users need decreases when users\ntransition from the Discovery phase to the Maintenance\nphase.",
        "However, this does not mean that tools should\ncollect less data during the Maintenance phase.",
        "Instead,\nonly the amount of data presented to the user should\ndecrease.",
        "We suggest tools should continue collecting as\nmuch data in the Maintenance phase as during the\nDiscovery phase.",
        "This ensures that if a user who is in the\nMaintenance has to transition to the Discovery phase\nbecause of a new problem, the user can immediately reflect\non her data.",
        "We\nidentified six types of questions: Status, History, Goals,\nDiscrepancies, Context, and Factors.",
        "We discuss how\npeople answered these questions using existing tools and\nthe problems that they encountered.",
        "Identifying these\nquestions is important because they require different\nanswers and different kinds of data, which have\nimplications on how tools should support them.",
        "Ubicomp\ntechnologies play a big role in addressing these needs\nbecause what data is collected and how data is collected\naffect how people reflect on their data.",
        "We also discovered that these questions are not asked at the\nsame time.",
        "We identified two distinct phases in which\npeople ask certain questions more often than others:\nDiscovery and Maintenance.",
        "The distinction between the\nphases is important because it highlights the need for\npersonal informatics tools to support different information\nneeds, and to be better tailored to users’ current needs,\ninstead of providing them all the tools to answer all six\nquestions at once (when they do not need all of them).",
        "Additionally, the phases are not static; people's information\nneeds change.",
        "They transition from Discovery to\nMaintenance, and vice versa.",
        "Again, Ubicomp can play a\nbig role here supporting the different information demands\nof the two phases and the transitions between them.",
        "Though we did not conduct a controlled study to observe\nhow the questions differ between the phases because it is\nout of the scope of this research, the identification of the\nquestions and the phases is an important first step towards\nthe development of future controlled studies.",
        "For example,\nwe could create visualizations for each of the questions then\nobserve whether people use certain visualizations more\noften than others based on what phase they are in.",
        "visualizations that answer History, Goals, Context, and\nFactors questions, while people who are in _ the\nMaintenance phase will use visualizations that answer\nStatus and Discrepancy questions.",
        "As evidenced by articles on personal informatics [3,30] and\nthe growing Quantified Self community around the world\n(http://quantifiedself.com/), more and more people are\nusing personal informatics tools.",
        "However, current personal\ninformatics tools are not designed with a_ sufficient\nunderstanding of users’ self-reflection needs.",
        "This study\ntakes one step towards an understanding of these needs.",
        "We\nidentified six main questions, which people ask in varying\nfrequency between two phases.",
        "We presented features that\nshould be supported in personal informatics tools and\ndiscussed ways that Ubicomp can provide the necessary\nsupport.",

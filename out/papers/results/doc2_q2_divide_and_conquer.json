        "UbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nUnderstanding My Data, Myself:\nSupporting Self-Reflection with Ubicomp Technologies\n\nIan Li’, Anind K. Dey’, Jodi Forlizzi'”\n'Human Computer Interaction Institute, “School of Design\nCarnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, PA 15213\nianli@cmu.edu, {anind, forlizzi}@cs.cmu.edu\n\nABSTRACT\n\nWe live in a world where many kinds of data about us can\nbe collected and more will be collected as Ubicomp\ntechnologies mature.",
        "The model also highlights that the\n\n406\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nstages are inter-related, i.e., problems from the earlier\nstages affect the later stages.",
        "Some projects have applied exploration\ntechniques on personal data.",
        "For example, Frost and Smith\nused visualizations to help diabetic patients explore the\nrelationship between their blood glucose level and the types\nof food they consumed [11].",
        "Commercial products, such as\nMint (expenditures), Nike+ (physical activity), and Wattson\n(electricity), use information visualizations to assist users in\nexploring their data for patterns and trends.",
        "Some\ninformation visualizations, such as ambient displays [22],\nglanceable displays [19], and information art [20], are less\nfocused on exploration of historical information.",
        "Instead,\nthey increase awareness of one’s current status (e.g., you’ve\ngot mail, your stock portfolio is currently up, your bus is\narriving) while minimizing cognitive load.",
        "This work\nexplores how people use these existing tools to answer their\nquestions about themselves and what problems they\nencounter.",
        "We use this exploration to define users’ specific\ninformation needs and to describe how Ubicomp\ntechnologies can provide support.",
        "In the next section, we describe our interviews of people\nwho used tools for personal informatics.",
        "We analyzed the\nresponses for the kinds of questions they asked and how\nthey used existing tools to answer them.",
        "INTERVIEWS\nThe goal of the interviews was to study how people explore\nand reflect on the data they collect for personal informatics.",
        "Paper Session: How Healthy?",
        "We conducted interviews with people who were already\nself-tracking and reflecting on collected data.",
        "This helped\nus see behavior in a natural setting where people’s routines\naround tracking and reflecting were focused on their own\nneeds, rather than forcing people to use a system we\ndesigned.",
        "In the following sections, we describe how we\nrecruited participants and conducted the interviews.",
        "Recruitment\n\nWe advertised the study on Craigslist, the Quantified Self\nblog, and a campus recruiting web site.",
        "The recruitment\nletter stated that we were looking for users of self-\ntracking/personal informatics tools, such as Mint, Nike+,\nMoodJam, etc.",
        "People interested in the study completed a\npre-questionnaire that asked what type of data they collect,\nfor how long, and contact information.",
        "They had to be\ncurrently using a tool for personal informatics and must\nhave used it for a month or more.",
        "We recruited a diverse\ngroup of people from around the nation and our city.",
        "Given\nthat we were only going to be able to talk to a limited\nnumber of people, the pre-questionnaire helped us ensure\nthat we recruited a set of participants using a range of tools\nfor a range of types of data.",
        "91 people responded to the pre-questionnaire (local: 76,\nremote: 15).",
        "We selected 15 people (P1-P15) from all the\nrespondents to participate in the study.",
        "Ten lived locally\nwithin the city limits and five lived remotely.",
        "A third were\nmale (5 vs. 10 females).",
        "The age ranges and their respective\ncounts were 20-25 (6), 25-30 (4), 30-35 (1), and over 50\n(4).",
        "Additionally, half were professionals (8) and the rest\nwere students (graduate: 4, undergraduate: 3).",
        "Procedure\n\nWe invited participants for a one-hour interview in either\nour lab or over Skype, depending on whether they lived\nlocally or remotely.",
        "Local participants were required to\nbring the tools they used for personal informatics (e.g.,\nlaptop, devices, notebooks) to the interview.",
        "Remote\nparticipants used Skype's Screen Sharing and Video\nfeatures to show us the tools they used.",
        "At the beginning of the interview, we introduced\nparticipants to the study.",
        "Participants signed the study\nconsent form and completed an online survey that asked\nabout their general personal informatics usage.",
        "The\nquestionnaire is a condensed version of the survey\ndescribed in [17].",
        "We sat with the participants in front of\ntheir laptop or mobile phone and asked them to describe\ntheir general usage.",
        "We observed participants as they used\ntheir tools.",
        "We asked them how they reflected on their data\nand to show us how they reviewed their data: What were\nthey looking for?",
        "What questions did they have?",
        "Why did\nthey ask these questions?",
        "How did they answer their\nquestions using their tools?",
        "What problems did they\nexperience while trying to answer their questions?",
        "Participants were compensated $10 (in cash or as Amazon\ngift certificates) for the one hour they spent with us.",
        "The\ninterviews were videotaped.",
        "407\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nRESULTS\n\nWe transcribed the interview recordings.",
        "We analyzed the\ninterviews by coding the responses line by line.",
        "We did not\nhave a pre-determined coding scheme before the analysis.",
        "Instead, we identified themes from the data as we processed\nthe responses.",
        "The themes emerged after we organized the\ncodes using affinity diagrams.",
        "During the analysis, we\nfocused on the reasons people reflected on their data, what\nquestions people were trying to answer when reflecting on\ntheir data, how the tools they used supported or prevented\nfinding answers to their questions), and what design\nfeatures in the tools they used supported their personal\ninformatics activity.",
        "Participant Information\n\nTo help focus our interviews, we asked participants to\ndescribe the primary data about themselves that they\ncollected [Table 1].",
        "The participants varied in the types of\ninformation they collected.",
        "The primary data that\nparticipants collected were: financial expenditures (3), sleep\n(3), weight (2), blood glucose level (2), exercise (1),\nproductivity (1), web history (1), books read (1), and life\nevents (1).",
        "Half of the participants collected one or more\ntypes of data.",
        "For example, P7, who collected the widest\nvariety of data, used Daytum and your.flowingdata to track\ntelevision shows and movies that she watched, restaurants\nshe dined at, and places she visited.",
        "She recorded her eating\nhabits with DailyBurn.",
        "Because of periods of insomnia, she\nused Fitbit to record her sleep patterns and physical activity\nlevels.",
        "She also complemented her sleep tracking by taking\nnotes about the quality of her sleep in YawnLog.",
        "There was\nalso a diversity of experiences in self-tracking.",
        "Four\nparticipants had been self-tracking for a month or two;\nseven participants, for a year or two; and three participants,\nfor more than three years.",
        "P3, who has diabetes, had been\ntracking her blood glucose level for 15 years.",
        "For several\nyears, she used a fingerstick blood glucose meter that\nrequired piercing the skin to draw blood 3 to 10 times a\nday.",
        "In the past year, she started using a Dexcom device,\nwhich has a sensor that adheres to the body and\ncontinuously takes blood glucose readings very 5 minutes.",
        "ID Primary Data Multiple Types?",
        "Reason\n\nP1 expenses No Behavior Change\nP2 weight Yes Behavior Change\nP3 blood glucose Was Behavior Change\nP4 exercise Was Behavior Change\nP5 expenses Yes Behavior Change\nP6 blood glucose Was Behavior Change\nP7 sleep Was Behavior Change\nP8 sleep Yes Behavior Change\nP9 sleep Yes Behavior Change\nP10 life events No Reminiscence\nP11 weight Was Behavior Change\nP12 expenses No Coordination\n\nP13 productivity No Behavior Change\nP14 web history No Retrieval\n\nP15 books No Sharing\n\nTable 1.",
        "The participants, their primary data, whether they\ncollected multiple types of data, and their reasons for collection.",
        "Paper Session: How Healthy?",
        "Reasons\n\nParticipants cited different reasons for collecting personal\ndata.",
        "Many participants (11 out of 15) self-tracked to reflect\non the data, because they wanted to change or maintain a\nbehavior.",
        "For example, P1 used Mint to maintain a budget\nafter moving to a new city.",
        "P8 tracked her sleep patterns\nand various factors that might affect the quality of her sleep\nusing the Sleeptracker watch and laptop application.",
        "Four\nparticipants collected data for other uses.",
        "P14 collected his\nweb history with Google Web History for /ater retrieval.",
        "For some kinds of data, participants did not use a device to\nmeasure their current status; instead, they used their own\n\n408\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nsenses.",
        "She still\n\n409\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\ntracks her blood sugar level, but she just takes mental notes\nof the meal, physical activity, and sleep quality prior to her\nblood sugar level measurement.",
        "Using different\n\n410\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\ntools for different types of data exacerbated this problem.",
        "Several participants who were in the Maintenance phase at\nthe time of the interviews were in the Discovery phase\n\n411\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nearlier in their self-tracking regimen.",
        "During the other times you were active, you\ndecided to walk your dog around the neighborhood.”\n\n412\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nSupporting the Discovery Phase\n\nThere are many opportunities for support in the Discovery\nphase because 1) there are many questions that are asked\nduring this phase; 2) some questions require data collected\nover a long time; and 3) some questions can be answered\nusing multiple types of data.",
        "413\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nHelp users transition from Discovery to Maintenance quickly\nThe Discovery phase is data intensive and can be\nburdensome to users.",

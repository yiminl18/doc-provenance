        "Although people know about these risks,\nsunlight related skin damages have increased over the past\ndecades.",
        "We have conducted a survey that sheds light on\nthis phenomenon and suggests that the missing natural sense\nfor UV radiation negatively influences people’s sun related\nbehavior.",
        "To address this issue, we have implemented Sun-\ndroid.",
        "Sundroid measures the incident UV radiation using a\nbody-worn sensing unit that communicates wirelessly with\nthe user’s smartphone.",
        "The phone thereby acts as a user in-\nterface to present the measured data in an intuitive manner,\nand to notify the user once a critical amount of sunlight has\nbeen reached.",
        "Sundroid can also be applied in other con-\ntexts, such as behavioral research or medicine.",

        "365\n\nmature skin aging and skin cancer are severe implications\nthat can result from an overexposure to sunlight, even if no\nimmediate signs of sunburn are visible [3].",
        "Both, sunburn as well as the mentioned long-term damages\nare caused by the ultraviolet (UV) radiation contained in the\nsunlight.",
        "In fact, most of the non-melanoma skin cancers are\nassociated with exposure to ultraviolet radiation [29].",
        "A con-\nsiderable fraction of people is aware of the risks originating\nfrom the sun.",
        "Nevertheless, the number of such skin cancer\ncases in the United States has constantly increased over the\npast years [30].",
        "Even though most people know about appro-\npriate protective measures, a large fraction of the population\ngets sunburned from time to time.",
        "A relevant finding of our survey is that inattention\nand the inability to correctly assess the UV intensity are two\nmajor reasons for excessive UV exposure and therefore for\npeople to get sunburned.",
        "Contributions.",
        "Following these findings, the main contribu-\ntion of this paper is a wearable prototype system that tracks\nthe wearer’s sunlight exposure in real-time.",
        "This is in con-\ntrast to existing wearable UV dosimeters, that are designed\nfor offline analysis only.",
        "The proposed system is designed\nin a modular fashion and consists of two parts: (1) A small\nsensor unit that measures the UV radiation and is equipped\nwith a Bluetooth module.",
        "(2) A smartphone application that\ncollects and processes the sensor unit’s measurements.",
        "The\nphone thereby acts as a generic processing platform, which\nmakes the system adjustable to a wide range of applications.",
        "The application presents the measured solar radiation data\nin a user-friendly manner.",
        "Moreover, it is able to notify the\nuser of the imminent danger due to UV radiation when ap-\npropriate, thereby taking into account critical factors such as\nthe specific skin type of the user or sunscreen applied.",
        "The modular design of our sensor system reduces the effort\nto address other usage scenarios, as basically only the smart-\nphone application needs to be modified.",
        "In fact, we also\nenvision applications that go beyond personal UV radiation\nmonitoring.",
        "Discussions with a dermatologist have shown\nthat our system could prove advantageous in several med-\nical settings.",
        "Moreover, we see various usage scenarios in\nresearch and large-scale sensing.",
        "For the discussed usage scenarios, it is essential that the\nsensor unit works reliably and provides accurate data.",
        "have thus paid particular attention to the technical sound-\nness of our system.",
        "By independently tracking UVA (400 nm\n- 315nm) and UVB (315nm - 280nm) radiation, we can\nwell approximate the action spectrum relevant to a given\napplication.",
        "An example is the erythema action spectrum,\nwhich describes the radiation relevant to sunburn that is ab-\nsorbed by the skin.",
        "The system has been calibrated using\ntwo six hours traces recorded at the World Radiation Center\nin Davos, Switzerland.",
        "The comparison with the reference\nmeasurements shows that our sensor module is able to ac-\ncurately measure the radiation absorbed by the skin at the\nposition of the sensor.",
        "In separate experiments we have in-\nvestigated the effect of a diffuser to reduce angle dependen-\ncies.",
        "Furthermore, we have conducted two pilot studies in\neach of which we have recorded real-world data of a person\nwearing the system during a specific outdoor activity.",
        "RELATED WORK\n\nExisting research efforts have investigated various aspects\nrelevant to our work both in medicine and in the field of\nubiquitous computing.",
        "In the following, we will briefly re-\nview major achievements and results from these different ar-\neas and sketch how our work relates to or was influenced by\nthese findings.",
        "UV Dosimeters.",
        "A variety of wearable UV dosimeters based\non different technologies have been proposed in the past.",
        "A\nrough categorization distinguishes between chemical, bio-\n\nlogical, and electronic methods to measure UV radiation [15].",
        "While electronic measurements facilitate the post-processing\nof various sensor inputs to approximate a desired action spec-\ntrum, biological and chemical dosimeters are more restricted\nwith respect to the spectral response.",
        "Biological dosimeters\ntypically agree well with the DNA damage spectrum [15].",
        "An example of the use of a biological dosimeter is a study\non long-term UV exposure of mountain guides [24].",
        "As opposed to biological and chemical dosimeters that ex-\nhibit an integral characteristic, electronic systems based on\nphotodiodes can measure the UV intensity at a given point\nin time.",
        "They thus do not only provide higher flexibility\nwith respect to post-processing, but are also well suited to\ncreating plots of the UV intensity over time.",
        "Examples for\nsuch systems are [1], [6], and [12].",
        "Like our sensor system,\nthese devices are designed to be worn by humans.",
        "However,\nall of them measure UV intensity using a single sensor and\nthus fail to take advantage of the flexibility given by post-\nprocessing of individual UVA and UVB values.",
        "Moreover,\nthey are primarily designed for the use in medical studies,\nand thus do neither provide a direct feedback to the user, nor\ndo they support real-time monitoring.",
        "As a consequence the\nintensity data can only be retrieved after a measurement se-\nries has been completed, which is in contrast to our system\nthat constantly transmits the sensor values to a mobile phone,\nand thus can directly take influence on the user’s behavior.",
        "Beside these limitations, the system described in [12] was\nused in a medical study to record the exposure to UV radi-\nation [36] of over 300 subjects.",
        "They found that sunburn is\ncorrelated with risk behavior.",
        "366\n\nUbiComp'11 / Beijing, China\n\nMobile phones.",
        "We have chosen the mobile phone as a pro-\ncessing platform as it provides high flexibility with respect to\napplications.",
        "Besides the powerful post-processing possibil-\nities, the advantages of a phone are its communication capa-\nbilities that make it a perfect gateway to transmit sensor data\nto servers [37], the permanent reachability by the user [27]\nand the wide variety of sensors readily available [23].",
        "For\nthese reasons mobile phones have been said to be an ideal\nplatform for context-driven reminders and alerts [34, 17],\nand for the use in large-scale sensing studies [23, 37].",
        "Reminders.",
        "In a recent study, it was shown that the overall\nadherence to sunscreen use can be improved by daily text-\nmessage reminders [2].",
        "As overly frequent reminders are\nlikely to be disturbing over time, in this paper we propose to\ntake the context into account to only issue reminders when\nrequired.",
        "Such context aware reminders have been proposed\nbefore, both, for medical scenarios [22, 20, 35, 28] and in\neveryday settings [34, 17, 18, 21, 8, 32, 13].",
        "For everyday\nsettings, location-based reminders have been examined par-\nticularly well, and have been found useful in several user\nstudies [21, 17, 34].",
        "These studies underline that people are\ninterested in and amenable to context-aware reminders.",
        "We\nthus expect that the context dependent reminders issued by\nSundroid can achieve a similar improvement of sunscreen\nadherence as reported by [2] in a much less obtrusive way.",
        "Medical applications.",
        "Many of the usage scenarios we en-\nvision are related to health related contexts, such as sunburn\nwarning or long-term behavioral training with respect to sun-\nlight exposure.",
        "A variety of studies proposes remote and\nself-monitoring systems in medical contexts and/or investi-\ngates their success.",
        "Examples include diabetes self-care [10,\n20, 35, 26], asthma management [28], context-aware pill re-\nminders [22] and generic remote monitoring frameworks [5,\n25].",
        "User studies thereby on the one hand show that peo-\nple are open to such systems [28, 35] and on the other hand\nindicate a positive effect on the patients’ health and/or com-\nfort [26, 22, 28, 10, 20].",
        "Several authors highlight the ad-\nvantages of mobile phones and PDAs as a platform and in-\nformation hub [20, 10, 35, 28, 26, 25, 5] and the usefulness\nof context-driven reminders [20, 22, 26, 28, 35], for example\ntriggered when the monitoring system detects low activity or\nthe need to take medication.",
        "Moreover, visual feedback of\nthe monitored data has said to be helpful by different stud-\nies [10, 26], in particular when it comes to train the user’s\nawareness of, or behavior in a given context.",
        "A design eval-\nuation of Logan et al.",
        "[20] further investigates relevant re-\nquirements as seen by the end users.",
        "In particular, they state\nthat user intervention should be avoided for data-gathering,\nmessages must be user understandable (1.e.",
        "in laymen terms),\nand that the system’s user interface needs be intuitive.",
        "[26] conclude that a wearable sensor\nsystem should be unobtrusive, contain as few components as\npossible, and should not attract attention to the wearer in the\npublic.",
        "When designing the prototype implementation of the\nSundroid system, we have taken these different factors into\naccount as far as possible given the hardware constraints.",
        "SURVEY\n\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the number of skin cancer\ncases has constantly increased over the past years and most\nof the non-melanoma skin cancers are associated with expo-\nsure to ultraviolet radiation [29].",
        "Moreover, a study in New\nZealand showed that 17.8% of the skin cancer cases can di-\nrectly be attributed to sunburn [33].",
        "Despite the warnings\nof health departments from all around the world, most peo-\nple have already experienced sunburn.",
        "In the following we\npresent an online survey that investigates possible reasons\nfor the mismatch between information and action, i.e.",
        "why\npeople get burned even though they know about the severe\nhealth risks.",
        "The online survey was conducted amongst 785 students (52%\nmale, 48% female) from different departments at our univer-\nsity.",
        "We wanted to know how often people get burned, and\nwhy this happens.",
        "For this purpose we have also investigated\nhow well people are informed about the risks of sunburn\nand protective measures.",
        "In addition, we wanted to know\nwhether they believe that a warning system could prevent\nsome of the sunburns they suffer, and whether they would\nbe willing to use such a system.",
        "We first asked four con-\ntrol questions related to sunburn and its risks.",
        "As expected\nthe participants are generally well informed.",

        "From the remaining participants al-\nmost all (96%) consider sunburn somewhat (38%) or very\n(58%) annoying.",
        "To understand why people are suffering\nsunburn despite the risks and the potential annoyance, we\nfurther asked for the reasons for getting sunburned.",

        "\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7-11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN\n\nWhy We Use and Abandon Smart Devices\n\nAmanda Lazar\nUniversity of Washington\nalaz@uw.edu\n\nJoshua Tanenbaum\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine\n\ntanenbaj@uci.edu\n\nABSTRACT\n\nSmart devices are becoming increasingly commercially\navailable.",
        "However, uptake of these devices has been slow\nand abandonment swift, which indicates that smart devices\nmay not currently meet the needs of users.",
        "To advance an\nunderstanding of the ways users benefit from, are\nchallenged by, and abandon smart devices, we asked a\ngroup of users to purchase smart sensing devices to advance\nthemselves towards a personal, self-defined goal.",
        "We found\nthat participants abandoned devices because they did not fit\nwith the their conceptions of themselves, the data collected\nby devices were perceived to not be useful, and device\nmaintenance became unmanageable.",
        "Participants used\ndevices because they had developed routines and because\ndevices were useful, satisfied curiosity, and held hope for\npotential benefit to them.",
        "We propose ways to reduce\nbarriers, motivate use, and argue for envisioning an\nadditional function of these devices for short-term\ninterventions, in addition to standard long-term use.",

        "For example, many activity trackers provide users\nwith the numbers of steps taken that day on the pretense\nthat knowing this information will cause lifestyle changes\nsuch as increased physical activity.",
        "For example, the\nHexoskin, a tanktop with embedded sensors, has the tagline\n“Know More, Live Better” (http:/(www.hexoskin.com/).",
        "The implication of this tagline is that having knowledge of\nthe metrics measured by this shirt — heart rate, heart rate\nvariability, breathing rate, breathing volume, steps,\ncadence, and calories — will lead the wearer to a better life.",
        "Given the promises made by the producers of these devices,\none might expect the widespread adoption of activity\ntrackers in a society so concerned with fitness and body\nimage.",
        "According to one report [15], one in ten Americans\nover the age of 18 owns an activity tracker.",
        "However, of the\npeople who do purchase activity trackers, many fail to use\nthe devices long term.",
        "More than half of people who own\nactivity trackers no longer use them, and a third of people\nwho own trackers stop using them within six months [15].",
        "This raises several questions.",
        "Who benefit from these\ndevices?",
        "Why are people not using them?",
        "Particularly, what\nare the reasons people abandon them?",
        "To explore these questions, a group of users were asked to\npurchase smart devices, sensors, and wearables to advance\nthemselves towards a _ personal,  self-defined goal.",
        "Participants were interviewed about their use after two\nmonths.",
        "In this paper, we explore the above questions and expand\non previous literature that discuss the motivations of smart\ndevice users and the barriers that they experience.",
        "We\nsuggest ways to design smart devices to reduce barriers and\nto increase motivation to use smart devices.",
        "Finally, we\nraise a question as to whether the ideal of sustained long-\nterm use is appropriate for all users and all goals.",
        "RELATED WORK\n\nSmart devices have been an area of focus for UbiComp and\nHCI for many years.",
        "We are using the term smart devices to\nrefer to devices that automatically gather information about\n\n\nusers or their environment to assist them in gaining\nknowledge about themselves and/or taking action.",
        "Other\nterms that have been used to refer to smart devices are\npersonal informatics systems [16] and quantified self [5].",
        "Routine and Motivation\n\nHCI and Ubicomp researchers have studied ways to\nincrease motivation to participate in healthy or socially\ndesirable behaviors.",
        "Across various theories, a variety of\nfactors are believed to contribute to motivation, such as\npersonal affect (e.g.",
        "feelings), social interaction (e.g.",
        "cooperation), and task related (e.g.",
        "curiosity) factors [3].",
        "Different individuals are motivated by different goals; in\nthe case of health, goals may include maintaining one’s\nown or another’s health state or increasing wellness [12].",
        "Researchers have explored the relationship between routine\nand motivation.",
        "describe the significant effect\nof routine on the motivation of families to take part in\nenvironmentally friendly behavior [4].",
        "Though routines\nsometimes serves as factors contributing to motivation, they\ncan also be independent of or even in opposition to\nmotivation.",
        "According to rational choice theory, consumers\nmake decisions based on maximizing the benefit to them,\nbased on their individual preferences, goals, and options\n[13].",
        "However, routine and habit drive many decisions and\nbehaviors, sometimes regardless of a desire to do something\ndifferent [13].",
        "Though routines regularly shape decisions,\nthey are not completely fixed.",
        "In the case of\nenvironmentally friendly behaviors, Gram-Hanssen argues\nthat, rather than due to environmental concerns, routines\nhave changed historically as a result of the introduction of\ntechnologies as well as how the social organization of\neveryday life has shifted [13].",
        "In particular, routines around\nICT use change very quickly [13].",
        "Studies of Smart Devices\n\nResearchers have explored the ways smart devices can be\nadopted into routines or build motivation.",
        "Researchers have\nexplored smart devices for purposes as diverse as\nencouraging more environmentally friendly behavior (e.g.",
        "[10]) and for home surveillance (e.g.",
        "[24]).",
        "Smart devices\nhave also been explored extensively in the domain of\nhealth.",
        "Activity trackers have been used extensively in this\ndomain, as have various sensors documenting other aspects\nimportant to health (such as sensors that monitor UV\nexposure [8]).",
        "Activity trackers and mHealth devices utilize\na variety of strategies to encourage users: Klasnja et al.",
        "outlined the ways these devices encourage wellness,\nincluding tracking and feedback, goal setting, social\ninfluence, and gamification [14].",
        "In addition to exploring a range of uses, researchers have\nexplored a range of sensors, from commercially available\nsensors to prototypes such as Lim et al.’s shoe-worn\npedometer that measures users’ physical activity and\nprovides feedback through varying intensities of light [18].",
        "Some researchers have even allowed participants in studies\nto design their own input devices [2].",
        "Another approach is\n\n636\n\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7-11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN\n\nto utilize a combination of commercially available and\nprototype interfaces.",
        "Examples of this approach are Walsh\net al.’s StepCity, which used commercially available Fitbits\nas an interface for a social game that they designed [25],\nand Lin et al.’s Fish’n’Steps, a virtual pet that responded to\nthe number of steps taken by participants wearing\ncommercially available pedometers [19].",
        "Studies Focused on Those with Acute Health Needs and\nUsers who Have Integrated Devices into their Lives\n\nMany studies have examined the use of smart devices with\nhighly motivated individuals, such as those with acute\nhealth needs.",
        "One example is participants who have\nattended physical therapy, which were the population\nstudied by Ananthanarayan et al.",
        "in the evaluation of a\nwearable prototype to assist in knee rehabilitation [1].",
        "Another group of highly motivated people are those who\nmay not have had specific physical disabilities or conditions\nbut were recruited for their interest in increasing physical\nactivity, such as participants in trials of UbiFit Garden, an\nactivity tracker integrated with a mobile phone that\nprovides users with a glanceable symbolic representation of\ngoal adherence [6][7].",
        "Another user base that has been studied extensively are\nusers who had integrated smart devices into their lives at\nthe point of study.",
        "interviewed a group of\nparticipants, the majority of whom were using activity\ntrackers at the start of the study [13].",
        "They found that\npersonal tracking was enmeshed in these participants’ lives\n(which they called ‘lived informatics) and that people\nchanged the tracker they used depending on their current\nshort-term or long-term goal.",
        "interviewed\nparticipants, all of whom were using activity trackers at the\ntime of the interview [9].",
        "Even under changing goals and\npractices over time, participants derived value and\nmotivation from use of devices, even over long periods of\nuse.",
        "administered surveys and interviews to\nindividuals engaged in personal data tracking and identified\nbarriers that occurred through the different stages of using\nsmart devices that they identified [16].",
        "In another study by\nLi et al., participants who had been self-tracking for at least\none month were interviewed about the questions they had\nabout the data they collected [12].",
        "investigated\nhow a group of Quantified-Selfers (whom they define as an\n“extreme users”) collected and explored personal data [5].",
        "These users created workarounds to manage barriers of the\ntechnologies they used, and many built their own smart\ndevices and systems.",
        "Implications from this study included\nways to support users in self-experimentation and reflecting\non data.",
        "A common finding in the studies described above\nis that participants successfully integrate the devices into\ntheir lives by either modifying the devices or their routines,\nand that they were willing to and interested in finding ways\nto work around device barriers.",
        "Although many of the participants in the studies mentioned\nabove had used trackers and integrated them into their lives\n\n\nSESSION: ENGAGEMENT AND DISENGAGEMENT\n\nbefore studies began, we suggest that there is also a need to\nexamine users who are not willing or able to integrate\ndevices in their lives.",
        "Studies Exploring Use and Abandonment\n\nSome researchers have explored the use of devices among\npeople who do not appear to be as willing to overcome\ndevice barriers.",
        "examined the ways personal\npreferences and _ characteristics affected use and\nabandonment of Fitbit activity trackers given to college\nstudents over six weeks [22].",
        "Participants abandoned Fitbits\nquickly (65% stopped using them at two weeks) and had\nissues remembering to wear the device.",
        "Additionally,\nparticipants were unsatisfied with the passive nature of the\nsystem and wanted active triggers about reaching their\ngoals.",
        "Some participants were also unsatisfied with the\nappearance and obtrusiveness of devices.",
        "Though this study\nexplored users who are not highly motivated, users used\ndevices manufactured by a single company, which does not\nexpose barriers across devices.",
        "Below, we describe a study in which participants who were\nnot recruited based on acute health needs or having\nintegrated devices into their lives were given funds to\npurchase whichever devices they wished to use.",
        "We explore\nquestions around use and abandonment of devices.",
        "METHOD\n\nProcedure\n\nParticipants were recruited through convenience sampling\nat a technology company.",
        "At the start of the study,\nparticipants were surveyed to find what goals, objectives,\nand passions they were interested in addressing with smart\ndevices.",
        "Participants were then given the opportunity to\npurchase up to $1,000 of smart devices to advance them\ntowards a goal they were passionate about (see Table 1 for\ngoals and devices).",
        "Participants were asked to choose their\nown goals based on the assumption that self-defined goals\nwould motivate them much more than pre-defined goals.",
        "Participants were free to choose whichever devices they\nwished to purchase and were reimbursed.",
        "Some participants\ntold other participants about the devices they had\npurchased, and because of this, certain devices were bought\nby many participants.",
        "Approximately two months later,\nparticipants were interviewed to discuss the devices\npurchased and the reasoning behind the purchases.",
        "Typically lasting about one hour, the semi-structured\ninterview also ascertained if and why the devices were still\nin regular use, whether participants experienced any\nbenefits or disadvantages from using the devices, as well as\nprevious experiences with smart devices.",
        "No monetary compensation was given to the participants,\nbut they were permitted to keep any devices purchased.",
        "Participants\n\n17 participants (13 male) were recruited.",
        "The participants\nincluded engineers, interns, an executive assistant, and the\n\n637\n\npartner of an employee.",
        "Five were in the age category 18-\n29, three 30-39, six 40-49, and three 50-59.",
        "Three had\ncompleted some college, ten had bachelor’s degrees, three\nhad master’s degrees, and one had a PhD.",
        "Nine identified as\nAsian or Asian American, five as white, and three as other.",
        "One person identified as Hispanic/Latino.",
        "Participants were recruited at a technology company.",
        "Their\nfamiliarity with technology was beneficial for multiple\nreasons.",
        "First, through their work and network, they were\nmore likely to be aware of different devices and therefore\nlikely selected a wider variety of devices than from a group\nunfamiliar with the landscape of smart devices.",
        "Second,\nthese participants were more likely to know how to\ntroubleshoot devices on their own, thus less likely to\nabandon devices due to technical issues.",
        "However, it is\nimportant to note that although the participants were\ncomfortable with computing devices in general, they were\nnot necessarily experts — or even knowledgeable —\nregarding the specific sensors that would advance\nthemselves towards the goals (e.g.",
        "health, productivity) that\nthey wished to pursue.",
        "In other words, participants may be\nable to troubleshoot the devices, but they will not\nnecessarily know the best ways to apply the devices\ntowards their goals.",
        "Analysis\n\nAll interviews were audio recorded and_ transcribed.",
        "Detailed notes from interviews and transcripts were\nanalyzed using open and axial coding by two of the\nresearchers to identify emergent themes.",
        "The coding\nscheme was discussed and finalized.",
        "Once the coding\nscheme was finalized, all interview data was then coded and\nshared with the research team.",
        "As themes emerged, they\nwere merged into the codebook.",
        "RESULTS\nBelow we describe the sensors purchased, and why\nparticipants used and stopped using devices.",
        "Participant goals and devices\n\nWhat were participant goals?",
        "During the initial interviews at the start of the study,\nparticipants expressed a range of goals, from increasing\nfitness to reducing pain to playing Ping-Pong better (see\nTable 1).",
        "Most of these goals (13) pertained to mental or\nphysical health and fitness, two to improving performance\nat a sport, and three to improving productivity or focus.",
        "Given that participants could choose any goal, it is\ninteresting that the majority chose health and fitness, which\nmay be the result of the current marketing of commercially\navailable smart devices.",
        "Surprisingly, devices purchased often did not appear to map\nto goals.",
        "For example, P7 purchased the Misfit Shine, a\nwearable pedometer, although his goal was to reduce his\nneck and shoulder pain.",
        "This suggests that either users may\nnot have the expertise of how devices would suit their goals\nor users may not have the expertise of how their goals can\n\n\nbe reached.",
        "Another possibility is that devices do not exist\nthat matches some of these goals.",
        "This issue is explored\nfurther in the discussion.",
        "What kinds of devices were used?",
        "The majority of devices used were health or fitness sensors,\ncorresponding to the majority of goals (see Table 1).",
        "Interestingly, though participants were free to purchase any\ntype of device, the majority purchased wearable devices.",
        "Of\nthe 49 devices used, 35 were purchased with study funds\nand 14 were obtained some other way during the study\nperiod or before the study had started (purchased with\npersonal funds, purchased with work funds for a different\nproject, found, or borrowed from a participant who had\npurchased the device).",
        "Why Did Participants Stop Using Devices?",
        "Participants abandoned almost 80% of devices purchased\nfor this study within the first two months (see Table 2).",
        "Sensors were abandoned for a variety of reasons, primarily\nin three categories: devices not fitting with participants’\nconceptions of themselves, collected data not being useful,\nand devices requiring too much work and maintenance.",
        "Did not fit with their conceptions of themselves\n\nParticipants frequently referred to other types of people (as\nopposed to themselves) for whom devices might be more\nuseful.",
        "Most frequently mentioned were people with what\nwere considered extreme fitness needs, such as those trying\nto lose large amounts of weight and athletes.",
        "For example,\nregarding whether her devices advanced her toward her\n\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7-11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN\n\ngoal of increasing physical activity, P12 said, “...",
        "I don't\nreally need to know this information every single day.",
        "If I\nwere an avid health freak, maybe, but I'm not.” Participants\nalso mentioned older adults as benefiting more from\ndevices, as they were likely to have more health needs.",
        "Participants saw sensors as appropriate for others, not\nthemselves, and therefore had less interest in using them.",
        "Data collected was not useful\n\nParticipants perceived the data collected as not useful\nbecause they were not interested in the level of information\nthe data gave them.",
        "Many participants mentioned that the\nnumber of steps they took was not interesting — including\nparticipants who had decided to purchase smart pedometers.",
        "Some reasons participants mentioned that steps were not\ninteresting were that walking was not considered exercise\n(P10) or that walking did not impact mood, which the\nparticipant had actually learned by wearing the sensor (P9).",
        "Even sensors that were more specialized than pedometers\nwere not seen as beneficial: the specialized sports sensors\n(94Fifty basketball and Babolat tennis racket) did not\nprovide the information that participants found most useful\n(such as whether or not the basketball went through the\nhoop).",
        "Additionally, one participant who exercised 18 hours\na week said, “How can a Fitbit measure [how fit I’m\ngetting]?",
        "They don't know that.",
        "It doesn't really matter if I\ndo a hundred sit-ups... a trainer, they tell you what is it that\nyou [should] eat, how much sleep [you should] get, and\nwhat kind of quantities of protein you [should] eat versus\nvegetables, or things like that.” Interestingly, the more\n\n[id [Goal (vice\n\nReduce neck pain\n\nStay hydrated, feel at peak, reduce headaches\n| P4_| Getbetteratbasketbal | Jawbone, 94Fifty basketball\n| P5_| Detect heart issues, maintain healthy body & weight | MioAlpha heart rate sports watch, Metawatch*\n| P6__| Be more fit, have more energy, lose belly __i| Muse, Mio Alpha, Fitbit, Withings scale, Metawatch*\n| P9 | Feel good, determine the reason behind losing focus\n\n_ .",

        "Other participants were not interested in the collected data\nbecause they would know that information even without\nusing the device.",
        "P2 said, “If I go to bed at eight and count\neight hours...",
        "I'm going to know.",
        "It's common sense.",
        "I went\nto bed at this time, and I woke up at this time.” The devices\ndid not provide any new or useful information to\nparticipants, so they did not see a reason to use the devices.",
        "Another reason data was not useful to participants was\nbecause it was unprocessed.",
        "Participants did not know what\nto do with the data: as P12 said, “It gave me a lot of\ninformation, but I don't know what to do with any of this\ninformation.... My heart rate is this much.",
        "But I don't know\nwhat that means.",
        "Am I supposed to be within this range and\nthis range?",
        "If 1 am, what does that mean?” P16 said “I don't\nknow what to do with that sort medical data once I've\ncollected it...",
        "I'm not in that kind of professional capacity to\nanalyze the data.” Through statements such as_ these,\nparticipants such as P12 and P16 expressed they lacked the\nskill and expertise to interpret data collected by the devices.",
        "Interestingly, they did not mention attempts to decipher\ndata by utilizing online resources or healthcare\nprofessionals, even though some of this information (such\nas suggested ranges for heart range by age) is freely\navailable online.",
        "Participants may not have realized that\nthese resources were available and might need more explicit\ninstruction on how to interpret data.",
        "As described above, there was often no instruction or\nprompting given to users on how to analyze collected data.",
        "Participants were not interested in quantifying behavior just\nfor the sake of getting a number; they wanted to know what\nto do with that number.",
        "As P16 said, “Wearing the watch\ndoesn't help me to sleep better...",
        "I wanted to be healthy, but\nwearing the watch is not going to give me better sleep or\nmake me healthier.",
        "It just tells me whether I have a good\nsleep or a bad sleep... it's not productive or useful.” In this\ncase, the data collected were not only unprocessed, but also\ndid not give the participant any actionable information.",

        "This\nhappened when participants could not meet device goals\nbecause of environmental factors, such as P1 (trying to\nreduce neck pain) who said, “I would take [the] LumoBack\n[posture sensor] off when I go home because at that point\nI'm with my daughter...",
        "I'm in all kinds of different\npositions.",
        "My posture sucks all night and I know that.",
        "I\ndon't need to be bothered by it.” Even when participants\ncould alter behavior, some noted feeling that they did not\nhave to meet goals set by the manufacturers of the device.",
        "Regarding meeting the default goal of 10,000 steps, P7 said,\n\"I'm doing this for myself...",
        "If I get it, I get it.",
        "If I don't, I\ndon't.",
        "In general, you just know you need to exercise more.”\nThe goals advocated by the device manufacturers did not\npossess greater authority than messages participants\nencountered promoting health behaviors on a regular basis.",
        "Participants did not perceive real repercussions to not\nsatisfying the device and viewed advice from the device as\nsuggestions rather than prescriptions.",
        "Too much extra work/maintenance\n\nExtra work and maintenance was a significant issue for\nmany participants, especially because they were getting so\nlittle benefit.",
        "For example, P9 had been using the Samsung\nGear Fit smart watch, to control his phone without taking it\nout of his pocket.",
        "He lamented that “just to have that one\nbenefit [of controlling a phone] I have to: one, charge it.",
        "Two, wear it on my other wrist.",
        "And three, always make\nsure it's paired with Bluetooth.",
        "[Also], it's wasting my\nphone's battery to keep that Bluetooth connection paired\nand I'd have to charge [the phone] as well.” Participants\nacknowledged that if the device had been more useful, they\nwould have been willing to make more of an effort; when\nasked why he was not using his device, P10 said, “Other\nthings.",
        "Other commitments I have to do.",
        "Not enough time.",
        "I\nguess I [would] make time if it's interesting enough.",
        "It\ndidn't seem interesting enough.” The devices did not yield\nenough value for participants to be willing to engage in the\ntime consuming process of maintaining devices.",
        "A high frequency of maintenance was a factor that greatly\ndiscouraged participants from use.",
        "The need to charge\ndevices often was mentioned by many as _ highly\ninconvenient.",
        "Having to provide input to the device\nfrequently (such as calibrating the LumoBack posture\nsensor or entering food into a food diary connected to the\nJawbone) was also mentioned as an obstacle.",
        "Participants\nconsidered benefits when determining how much work they\nwere willing to do; P5 questioned the value of smart\ndevices, “... years ago, you [wore] a watch that you\n[wouldn’t] have to charge for a whole year.",
        "We are going\nback.",
        "It's okay [with the phone] because it replaces [your]\nlaptop partially... What is that on the wearable that would\noffset that inconvenience of recharging every few days...?”\nSome participants turned off the “smart” functions to\nreduce the need to charge devices.",
        "P10 said that his Mio\nAlpha heart rate watch “charges fairly often if I was using\n\n\nthe heart rate monitor.",
        "After a point...",
        "I would use it more\nlike a timepiece rather than a heart rate monitor.”\n\nAnother way the use of smart devices was too much extra\nwork was when use did not fit with routines.",
        "Participants\ndid not remember to or want to do seemingly low-effort\nactivities such as tapping devices to put them in a mode to\ntrack sleep.",
        "Some participants grew tired of bringing tablets\naround with them as their phones were not compatible with\ndevices.",
        "They also mentioned that it took time to get into a\nroutine of use, even to remember to put on a device; “Even\na watch, it's taught.",
        "It's trained.",
        "I've been wearing a watch\nsince I was six.",
        "It's a learned behavior.",
        "I'm comfortable\nwearing a watch.",
        "If I don't wear a watch, I feel naked.",
        "I feel\nsomething's missing.",
        "But, with a wearable, I just don't have\nthat patience to train myself to learn to wear it.",
        "I think the\nbiggest thing is the benefit.",
        "I just don't see that much\nbenefit.” P7 acknowledged that it was possible to train\nhimself to remember to wear the device, but given that\nthere was so little benefit, it was not worth doing.",
        "Some participants managed to develop a routine, but once\nthey fell out of the routine, even for a day, they often did\nnot recover.",
        "Three participants mentioned vacation affected\ntheir use: P17, who periodically lacked Internet on vacation,\nsaid, “You kind of lose interest after you lose that first\ninstance of focus on it.",
        "After I went on vacation...",
        "I didn't\ncare anymore because I had stopped looking at it for four or\nfive days... it lost all appeal to me.” The device running out\nof charge was also a reason many fell out of routine: as P9\nsaid, “...",
        "I forgot to charge it one day, and I haven't charged\nit since.",
        "If it was always charged, I think I'd still wear it.”\nSome participants explained that they felt a sense of relief\nwhen they fell out of a routine: P14 said “Once I went a few\ndays without it: it was like ‘I guess I really don't need it to\nsurvive’... you're like, ‘It feels good not to have to work\nout.",
        "It feels good without something buzzing at me to tell\nme my posture is crappy.’\" Sometimes, the realization that\nthey felt relief or did not miss the device after falling out of\na routine led participants to consciously abandon the\ndevice: P12 said “I just forget about it, and I guess that\nstarted the decline of me wearing it to bed, because I realize\nit's not changing my life.",
        "At that point it was like, I'm not\nwearing it, and it's not making a difference at all... so why\nam I bothering wearing it?” Again, the lack of benefit from\nusing the device led participant to abandon the device rather\nthen attempting to reintegrate it into their routine.",
        "Participants hesitated to expend effort adjusting devices or\nthe mental energy to become accustomed to uncomfortable\ndevices.",
        "When a device was extremely uncomfortable, it\nwas often abandoned hastily, even when participants were\ninterested in the information tracked.",
        "Several participants\nsaid they were not used to wearing jewelry or bracelets and\nthe device felt uncomfortable.",
        "Another element considered\nuncomfortable was when devices had to be worn tight\naround the body to function properly (such as the\nLumoBack, Hexoskin, and heart rate monitors).",
        "Tight\n\n640\n\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7-11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN\n\ndevices were perceived as even more uncomfortable when\nbands were made of rubber and participants sweat in them.",
        "Similar to uncomfortable devices, obtrusive devices\nrequired extra work from participants.",
        "For example, P10\nsaid that he stopped using a wireless blood pressure monitor\nafter a single use because, “It was too big.",
        "It was\ncumbersome.",
        "It was difficult.",
        "It was not as mobile as I\nexpected it to be.” Conversely, some participants wore\ndevices that were perceived as unobtrusive even when they\ndid not see much value in the data.",
        "For example, P12 said\nthat “I think what makes me like the Shine [activity tracker]\nmost is just because it's so effortless.",
        "I don't think about it at\nall.",
        "See, because I don't even remember it's on me, and I\nrarely ever check it anymore.",
        "That's the only reason why I\nstill keep wearing it.” Even though P12 didn’t check her\ndevice and did not benefit from the data collected, it was\nvery unobtrusive, and she therefore continued to wear it.",
        "The challenges of individual devices described above were\ncompounded when participants had multiple devices, and\nparticipants had a negative perception of maintaining\nmultiple devices.",
        "Interestingly, almost all participants spent\nwell under $1,000 on devices, and most purchased two or\nfewer devices.",
        "When asked why they did not purchase more\ndevices, many said that they did not want to experience the\nburden associated with multiple devices; P14 said, “I just\ndidn't want to wear that many things...",
        "I didn't want to give\nmy entire life over to these devices.” Participants also\nreferred to a general sense of having too many\nresponsibilities in their lives that manifested in a desire to\nhave fewer devices.",
        "When asked why he did not like\nwearing devices, P11 said, “It's just one more thing.",

        "There are things that I have to do for those things.",
        "This\npiece of technology should enhance what things that I do\noutside rather than take up my brain space...” Like other\ntypes of work, not getting any benefit was the reason that\nmultiple devices caused so much frustration: “Carrying\nthese two, three devices, I used to keep track of the\ncharging...",
        "Eventually I thought, ‘What is the point of doing\nall these things?’\" (P13).",
        "Each additional device resulted in\nanother set of maintenance activities for participants.",
        "Why Did Participants Use Devices?",
        "Few devices were still being used at the exit interview, and\neven fewer at the time of this writing.",
        "Participants\nexplained what kept them using devices through the course\nof the study, even when eventually abandoned.",
        "Useful\n\nA subset of the participants had experiences where the\ndevice was useful.",
        "We categorize the ways the devices were\nuseful as major benefits and minor benefits, and momentary\nsmall benefits and benefits from “non-smart” features.",
        "Three participants experienced major benefits.",
        "P1 (who at\nthe time of this writing had stopped using the device but\n\n\nSESSION: ENGAGEMENT AND DISENGAGEMENT\n\nintended to wear it in the future) wore the LumoBack\nposture sensor for chronic neck pain.",
        "She thought her\nposture had improved significantly from her use of the\ndevice.",
        "She attributed her better posture to instantaneous\nfeedback but also because she was strengthening the\nmuscles involved in correct posture.",
        "P10 (who had stopped\nwearing his device, but planned to use it again in the future)\nlearned to control his anxiety and breathe deeply in social\nsituations from using the device.",
        "P15 said her device helped\nher get more healthy and active and lose weight.",
        "Some participants experienced minor benefits after they\nstopped wearing the devices, such as being more conscious\nof posture, getting up to walk around during the day, or\ntaking the stairs instead of the elevator.",
        "Many participants mentioned an increased awareness of\nphysical activity while wearing the devices, which we see\nas a momentary small benefit.",
        "While wearing the devices,\nsome participants initially tried to increase step counts.",
        "Another participant used the Phyode W/me, a heart rate\nsensor with a breathing app, to increase mindfulness during\nthe day.",
        "While participants appreciated these benefits when\nthey occurred, they did not necessarily persist.",
        "Participants also experienced benefit from “non-smart”\nfeatures, such as seeing the time or setting alarms.",
        "Several\nparticipants continued wearing smart devices as watches\nand either turned off or did not view the smart functions.",
        "Conversely, smart devices worn on the wrists that did not\nshow the time (such as the Fitbit Flex) were abandoned by\nsome participants who did not want to wear multiple\ndevices and therefore chose a watch over the device.",
        "Curiosity and novelty\n\nAs has been found in other studies (e.g.",
        "[20][23]), the\nnovelty of a device affects use.",
        "In this study, the novelty of\nthe device and curiosity about the device and data was a\ncompelling motivator for participants to begin using\ndevices, and many participants experienced enjoyment from\nplaying with a new “toy.” However, as P10 said, “[during\nthe] first few days, it was a new thing so it was novel\nenough that I didn't mind that extra hassle.",
        "After a while,\nthat negative impact was too much.” For many participants,\na drop off effect occurred as novelty diminished and the\ncost of maintaining the device became irritating.",
        "Curiosity was often sated after participants discovered some\nquantified number about their activities.",
        "P13 said, “After a\npoint I get a rough estimate as to how much I am walking\nevery day, so I don't need a step counter to tell me...",
        "I've\ngot a mental map.” Like P13, others lost interest in using\ndevices once they developed a sense of what data would be\ngenerated when they engaged in various activities.",
        "The drop off effect was less apparent for a participant using\na device sporadically: “Fitbit is for day-to-day use, and the\nGarmin Fenix [a GPS navigator and activity tracker] is only\nfor a particular use, and at a particular time... the number of\ntimes I go for hiking is maybe once a week... so I don't\n\n641\n\nmind carrying that extra device, only for that hiking\npurpose...",
        "But for the FitBit, it's a day-to-day activity.",
        "After\na point, it loses its relevance.” It appears that since the\ndevice was for a dedicated activity, the participant was able\nto overlook issues with the device that would have\nprevented him from using it for an everyday activity.",
        "Had\nhe gone hiking more regularly, he thought it was likely that\nhe would be bothered by the obtrusiveness of the device.",
        "Hope for potential use\n\nAnother factor that kept participants using devices was\nhope that the current capabilities of devices would be\nextended someday with new ways to process recorded data.",
        "Participants hoped that data would benefit themselves, and\nsome also mentioned that they hoped their using the\ntechnology would lead to benefits for others.",
        "A few stated\nplans to devise their own algorithms to correlate different\naspects of their behavior.",
        "However, none of the participants\nhad designed these systems at the time of the interview.",
        "This hope for potential use kept some participants using and\nincreased the frequency with which they used devices after\nthey had lost interest in the novelty of the data, even when\ndata was not useful to them.",
        "This expectation for future\nbenefit led participants to stop using devices that did not\nstore data.",
        "Because the potential benefit came from data,\ndevices that did not store data were less desired.",
        "The hope for use of collected data may be why most\nparticipants placed a great deal of importance on accuracy,\ndespite many not viewing the data.",
        "The desire for accuracy\nimpacted which devices participants chose and kept using.",
        "Although P10 had been benefiting from using his heart rate\nmonitor to learn about how to manage his anxiety in social\nsituations, hearing that the device was inaccurate was one\nfactor that led to his abandonment of the device.",
        "He\nexplained that he “felt cheated” when he heard that the\ndevice was not accurate, and that it bothered him because\n“If [the heart rate measurements were] not objectively\naccurate, I was going by some number they produced and I\ndidn't know whether to believe it or not.” He went on to say\nthat he still used the strategies he had learned from using\nthe heart rate monitor, but had “stopped relying on the\nsensor’.",
        "Even though the number “did not seem that off” to\nhim and he had not verified that the device was inaccurate,\nthe chance of the device being inaccurate was enough for\nhim to stop trusting the data generated by the sensor.",
        "Developed routine of use\n\nDespite neither receiving benefit nor having their curiosity\nsatisfied, participants would sometimes persist in using a\ndevice because they had developed a routine of doing so.",
        "For example, when asked why he still wore his Misfit Shine\neven though he no longer viewed the data, P17 said, “I\nthink I just developed a habit over the last couple of\nmonths...",
        "I guess I just put it on to put it on.” Even when\nparticipants saw little use, they still wore it “because it's\nkind of a habit now” (P17).",
        "Participants justified continuing\n\n\nthe “habit” with a variety of reasons, including getting use\nout of something that they had purchased.",
        "Additionally, as\nlong as these devices were not obtrusive and did not require\nextra work, participants would continue using the device\nuntil an issue arose that interrupted the routine, such as\nmaintenance activities or travel.",
        "This suggests that once\npeople begin to use a device, they may be likely to continue\nusing it simply because they grow accustomed to doing so.",
        "Seven participants were still using devices at the end of the\nstudy.",
        "Pl and P15 still used their devices because they\nfound them useful.",
        "P17 did not look at the data from his\nShine but had developed a routine of wearing it.",
        "P6, P7,\nP12, and P13 wore their devices to satisfy curiosity or\nbecause they saw potential use.",
        "This suggests that though\ncuriosity faded for many participants, some continued to be\ncurious about their data, which sustained their use.",
        "It is\ninteresting to note which types of devices were still being\nused compared to how many were purchased.",
        "Of two smart\nscales used in the course of the study, both were still being\nused.",
        "Of thirteen activity trackers used during the study, six\nwere still being used two month later, half of which were\nthe Misfit Shine (the activity tracker that was noted by\nparticipants as requiring very low maintenance).",
        "Out of\nthirteen smart watches used over the course of the study and\nthe six posture detectors, only one of smart watch and one\nposture detector was being used at the end of the study.",
        "These numbers suggest that participants were more likely to\ncontinue to use activity trackers, particularly unobtrusive\nones, than smart watches (many of which had similar\nfunctions as activity trackers, such as counting steps).",
        "One\npossible explanation for this discrepancy is that activity\ntrackers required less charging and also were less bulky.",
        "Limitations\n\nWe acknowledge several limitations to this study.",
        "First,\ngiving participants funds to purchase devices may have\naffected their choices and use of devices.",
        "One participant\nmentioned that he would have valued the device more if he\nhad spent his own money and felt that he had to “get [his]\nmoney’s worth.” Providing participants with funds may\nhave had the opposite effect for others; some said that they\nused the device or felt an obligation to exercise because of\nthe study.",
        "However, many who were using devices for\nthose reasons had stopped by the time of the interview.",
        "Moreover, two months is not necessarily long enough to see\nif users have adopted a device (or would abandon a device\nshortly after the study ended).",
        "However, most of the\nparticipants who were still using devices were not overtly\ncommitted to continuing use.",
        "Waiting longer to interview\nparticipants would have meant that the exact reasons for\ncontinued use and benefits would have faded.",
        "The reader\nshould therefore not assume that the users fully adopted the\nten devices that were being used at the exit interview.",
        "Furthermore, participants used a slew of devices.",
        "The\ndevices had varying functionalities and affordances and\ntherefore impacted the experiences of participants\n\n642\n\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7-11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN\n\ndifferently.",
        "However, allowing users to select their devices\nallowed them to buy the device that was potentially most\nuseful to them, thereby increasing the chance that they\nmight benefit from them.",
        "This approach also resulted in\nsimilar findings across different types of devices (such as\nissues with charging), which strengthens their significance\nand likelihood to apply to other similar devices.",
        "Additionally, seven participants had used smart devices\npreviously, though not for an extended amount of time.",
        "Future studies should examine people with less exposure to\nsmart devices, as they might display different patterns of\nuse and motivations and barriers to use.",
        "Finally, not surprisingly, some participants, especially the\nengineers, expressed very technology-positive views.",
        "Future studies would be well served to examine people with\nmixed attitudes to technology.",
        "Additionally, it is likely that\nbeing in a technology company affected the opinions and\nexperience of participants in this study.",
        "For example, it is\npossible that a greater familiarity with the way a device\nworks (and should work) could lead to increased frustration\nover a device not working properly or being designed\npoorly.",
        "It is important for researchers to explore the\nexperience of participants with other backgrounds and work\nexperience.",
        "This study also focuses on a group limited in\nterms of diversity.",
        "In particular, the sample was primarily\nmale, and this gender ratio may have affected the devices\npurchased as well as their use and abandonment [22].",
        "Given the limitations described above, we make no claims\nto experimental validity, or to any objective “truth” in this\nwork.",
        "While the responses that we observed do not\nconstitute a ground truth, however, they are both “real” and\n“useful” in that they represent a diverse sampling of\nwearable device usage that has been driven by the\npreferences of the subjects, rather than a _ top-down,\nexperimental structure.",
        "We contend that the collected data\nrepresents an important first look at some of these identified\nbehaviors and attitudes.",
        "We believe that the themes and\nobservations that arose from this data are useful markers of\ntechnology adoption strategies and motivations.",
        "DISCUSSION AND DESIGN IMPLICATIONS\n\nIn this paper, we present a study describing how\nparticipants used and abandoned a variety of smart devices.",
        "Below we provide design recommendations to lower\nbarriers and increase motivation.",
        "Though many of these\nsuggestions can lead to long-term use, we stress the\nimportance of considering designing for short-term use.",
        "Lowering Barriers for Users\n\nWhen users were able to develop a routine of use that was\nnot obstructed by extra work or maintenance, they kept\nusing devices, even when perceived benefits were minimal.",
        "While this is not a novel finding, our contribution is to\nemphasize the enormous importance of lowering barriers of\nuse of use for users who are not highly motivated.",
        "We\noutline some ways to lower barriers of use below.",
        "SESSION: ENGAGEMENT AND DISENGAGEMENT\n\nEncouraging routines\n\nIt is key to help users develop a routine from the first use,\nas participants who were unable to develop a routine of use\nabandoned devices more quickly than those who were able\nto do so.",
        "One way of encouraging routines is latching on to\nan existing user’s routine, for example outfitting a watch\nthat the user wears every day with a smart device.",
        "Designers should also examine ways to incentivize users to\ndevelop routines.",
        "One approach may be to hamess curiosity\nby revealing different metrics (e.g.",
        "steps walked, hours\nslept) as rewards for regular use.",
        "This would assist users in\ndeveloping routines of use while simultaneously prolonging\ncuriosity, a strong but short-lasting motivator for use.",
        "Minimizing maintenance\n\nCharging and other types of extra work/maintenance often\nled to participants falling out of routines, after which they\nwould never use the device again.",
        "It seems clear that these\ndevices need to be designed to avoid this pitfall.",
        "The\namount of time and effort needed to charge a device was an\nenormous issue for participants.",
        "One especially popular\ndevice in the study, the Misfit Shine, was appreciated due to\nnot needing to be charged (it operates on a coin cell).",
        "We\nrecommend that designers consider power approaches such\nas coin cells, which do not require charging, or other\napproaches that require minimal charging.",
        "Participants felt especially burdened by multiple devices,\neven when each did not require much effort individually.",
        "Additionally, a segment of the current market appears to be\nsplintering into single-use devices (e.g., a bracelet that\nmeasures UV exposure- http://www.junebynetatmo.com).",
        "Based on the data from this study, we contend that a single\ndevice should do as much as possible and allow users to\nignore or turn off the unused features.",
        "Of course, packing\nmore functionality into one device while seeking ways to\ncharge the device less is a major engineering challenge.",
        "Appealing to identity\n\nMarketing and branding also played a role in whether or not\nparticipants embraced their devices.",
        "Participants felt that\nsmart devices such as activity trackers were for the “avid\nhealth freak” (P12) and not for them.",
        "Marketers show\nimpossibly slender models practicing yoga poses on the\nbeach after jogging a dozen miles, but the lifestyle depicted\nin these images can alienate the user who does not affiliate\nwith this image.",
        "Previous studies have advised that devices\nbe designed so they do not cause users to feel “out-of-\ncharacter” [18] or that casings for trackers be accessorized\nto fit user’s “mood, outfit, or occasion” [22].",
        "We take these\nsuggestions a step further to suggest devices be presented to\nusers with language and images that fit their lifestyles and\nconceptions of themselves.",
        "For example, the rubber Fitbit\nband resembles a LiveStrong band, which may be more\nappropriate for those who identify with an athletic persona.",
        "Alternate casings allow users to wear Fitbits that better\nmatch their identities, such as a designer who allows users\nto “Transform [the] Fitbit Flex tracker into a super chic\naccessory” (http://www.fitbit.com/toryburch).",
        "Designers\n\n643\n\nshould consider the types of images the individuals using it\nwish to project in designing the appearance of the device.",
        "Increasing Motivation for Users\n\nHowever, even if all barriers were lowered, people like\nsome of the participants in this study might still not engage\nin long-term use of devices for a variety of reasons.",
        "These\ndevices and the data they generate simply do not fit their\nneeds or motivations.",
        "In fact, it appears that barriers to use,\nsuch as extra work or maintenance, are especially\nproblematic because users perceive so little benefit from the\ndevices.",
        "Participants were unwilling to sacrifice personal\ncomfort or convenience for the marginal benefit they got\nfrom these devices.",
        "They were not satisfied seeing data for\nthe sake of seeing data after initial novelty wore off, nor\nwere they willing to correlate data or create the rich systems\nseen in studies of highly motivated users (e.g.",
        "[5], [16]).",
        "Additionally, participants did not have the expertise needed\nto find, interpret data, and create plans for action from their\ndevices.",
        "For example, though many participants had health-\nrelated goals, few expressed an understanding of what types\nof devices would be appropriate for their health goal, how\nto interpret data generated from devices, and what kinds of\nactions they should take based on the data.",
        "The following\nfour recommendations arise from the most commonly\nexpressed desires of our participants.",
        "We contend, in all of\nthese cases, a unifying theme for a desire that rather than\nthe user, the device should handle the work and complexity.",
        "Employ user language\n\nCurrently, many devices present users with raw data (e.g.",
        "number of steps).",
        "Users wanted a summary using terms and\nlanguage they understood, rather than raw data.",
        "They do not\nwant to interpret the data themselves.",
        "Rather, participants\nvoiced interest for something like a report card, which told\nthem whether they had done well or poorly that week.",
        "Designers should investigate ways to provide this type of\n‘report card’ feedback to users, such as by comparing steps\none week to the previous week or to peers.",
        "Consider proactive feedback\n\nUsers did not want to have to remember to look at devices,\nas it was not a part of their regular routine and thus served\nas ‘just another thing to remember.’ Notifications could be\nuseful to these participants, particularly if location or\nactivity sensing is incorporated to minimize the chance of\ndisrupting an important activity.",
        "Coach the user\n\nSome participants did not have the knowledge or skills\nrequired to take action and wanted to be coached with\nactionable feedback.",
        "For example, the participants who\npurchased sports sensors (the smart basketball and the\ntennis racket) were not satisfied with sensors that showed\nthem the angle they had shot or hit the ball- they wanted\ndevices that would actually instruct them to swing and\nthrow with a better outcome.",
        "Designers should consider the\npossibility that users may not know how to achieve their\n\n\ngoals or even how to start — incorporating some kind of\ncoaching would benefit this class of users.",
        "Involve the user’s personal history\n\nParticipants did not want to do calculations to determine\ntheir progress or keep track of their historical data, but did\nwant devices that were tailored to their personal history.",
        "P1\nwanted a system that could factor in that when she had poor\nposture a certain percentage of the day, it often resulted in\npain, and tell her when she was approaching that\npercentage.",
        "Participants felt that personalized suggestions\nwould be much more useful than generic suggestions.",
        "Provide Concrete Motivation\n\nSome participants requested functions or capabilities that\nlie beyond the current limits of science.",
        "Some commented\n(semi-jokingly) that sensors would be useful if they could\ndetermine the exact time they would die and what behaviors\ncould prolong their lives.",
        "Another participant, more\nseriously, said that he wanted a sensor that would tell him\nconcretely that he would have a certain outcome, rather\nthan offering vague assurances that he might feel happier.",
        "While this may not be feasible due to uncertainty in the\noutcomes of different actions, it may be helpful to utilize\nprobabilities to motivate different behaviors (for example,\n‘If you exercise one more day a week, you are 90% likely\nto live 1 year longer’).",
        "Though these probabilities may still\nbe considered too vague for some users, they can be more\nconcrete than they are currently.",
        "Reconceptualizing Abandonment as Short Term Use\nThe recommendations above are particularly pertinent to\nencourage long-term use of devices (though we believe they\nare good practice in general).",
        "Designing for long-term use\nis vital for devices that must be used regularly (e.g.",
        "such as\nglucose monitors) or for users who are willing and\ninterested in using devices long term.",
        "Despite the benefits of long-term use of devices, our\nanalysis leads us to believe that there is an under-explored\nclass of smart devices, particularly for wearables: those that\nmight be beneficial for short-term interventions.",
        "This\napproach challenges the dominant paradigm of designing\nfor long-term, continuous use and echoes Rooksby et al.",
        "that posit, “to track over the short term is not necessarily to\ngive up or fail” [21].",
        "Participants experienced many\nbenefits from short-term use that may, indeed, lead to long-\nterm changes.",
        "Yet these devices are marketed for continual\nand everyday use.",
        "Even when the participants had learned\nsomething useful or made a behavior change, participants\ninternalized abandonment of devices as failure.",
        "Additionally, elements of devices that are obtrusive or even\nirritating may be extremely helpful in the short term but\nunsustainable in the long term.",
        "Some users benefited when\ndevices were obtrusive- such as posture sensors that buzzed\nwhen they detected bad posture- but sustained use of these\ndevices annoyed them in the long run and led to\nabandonment.",
        "While not appropriate for all users and all\n\n644\n\nUBICOMP '15, SEPTEMBER 7-11, 2015, OSAKA, JAPAN\n\ndevices, short-term use is appropriate for those interested in\ndevices to satisfy curiosity as well as those who wish to\nalter routines or behaviors.",
        "Obtrusiveness and deviation\nfrom routine are not as off-putting when occasional.",
        "Curiosity and the desire for novelty can continue to be\nsatisfied when participants are not jaded by continual use.",
        "We stress that short-term use and abandonment can be an\neffective use of smart devices when users are able to more\ndeeply understand or alter habits and routines.",
        "Unlinking\nabandonment of devices with failure raises bigger questions\nabout the intended future of these devices: is the goal to\ncreate smart sensing systems that are continuously relevant\nand useful to a user or is the goal to create a device that\nsupports a user’s need even if that need is temporary?",
        "Can\nwe allow learning about ourselves to occur in spurts and not\nonly as a continual everyday process?",
        "Do we envision a\nfuture where we are dependent on our devices to keep us on\ntrack or do we see these devices as a tool for learning how\nto manage our lives and health ourselves?",
        "We propose\nembracing a short-term intervention mentality to broaden\nthe market for these devices, while supporting designs\nbetter suited to the lived practices of the everyday user.",
        "Already, the amount of electronic waste has a staggering\neffect on the environment as well as the individuals who\nlive where technology is processed and recycled (e.g.",
        "[27]),\nand the amount of time electronic devices are used before\nthey are discarded continues to shorten [26].",
        "In pursuing\nthis area of research, it is important to reflect on and\nexplore ways to create devices that will be used short term\nand discarded in an environmentally and_ ethically\nresponsible manner, such as through the use of water-\nsoluble electronics [28].",
        "CONCLUSION\n\nIn this paper, we present a study detailing a group of\nparticipants’ motivations, practices, and reasons for\nabandonments of smart devices for a group of participants.",
        "The paper contributes novel reasons that users use and\nabandon smart devices.",
        "By allowing participants to choose\ndevices and then interviewing them several months later,\nwe were able to see the ways people integrated devices into\ntheir lives or abandoned them and the factors for doing so.",
        "Based on what we learned from these participants, we\npresent design recommendations to lower barriers and\nencourage use.",
        "We also acknowledge that long-term use\nmay not be feasible for some users and purposes and\npropose short-term interventions as one way of increasing\nthe usefulness of devices for users.",
        "These findings have\nimplications for the design of the next generation of smart\ndevices that more closely meet the needs of users.",

        "However, uptake of these devices has been slow\nand abandonment swift, which indicates that smart devices\nmay not currently meet the needs of users.",
        "To advance an\nunderstanding of the ways users benefit from, are\nchallenged by, and abandon smart devices, we asked a\ngroup of users to purchase smart sensing devices to advance\nthemselves towards a personal, self-defined goal.",
        "We found\nthat participants abandoned devices because they did not fit\nwith the their conceptions of themselves, the data collected\nby devices were perceived to not be useful, and device\nmaintenance became unmanageable.",
        "Participants used\ndevices because they had developed routines and because\ndevices were useful, satisfied curiosity, and held hope for\npotential benefit to them.",
        "We propose ways to reduce\nbarriers, motivate use, and argue for envisioning an\nadditional function of these devices for short-term\ninterventions, in addition to standard long-term use.",
        "Author Keywords\nSmart devices; wearable devices; personal informatics\nsystems; self tracking.",
        "ACM Classification Keywords\nH.5.2 Information interfaces and presentation (e.g., HCI):\nMiscellaneous.",
        "INTRODUCTION\n\nSmart devices promise users a wealth of information that\nwill enable them to become the best versions of themselves.",
        "This reasoning follows the line of thought that more\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.",

        "For example, many activity trackers provide users\nwith the numbers of steps taken that day on the pretense\nthat knowing this information will cause lifestyle changes\nsuch as increased physical activity.",
        "For example, the\nHexoskin, a tanktop with embedded sensors, has the tagline\n“Know More, Live Better” (http:/(www.hexoskin.com/).",
        "The implication of this tagline is that having knowledge of\nthe metrics measured by this shirt — heart rate, heart rate\nvariability, breathing rate, breathing volume, steps,\ncadence, and calories — will lead the wearer to a better life.",
        "Given the promises made by the producers of these devices,\none might expect the widespread adoption of activity\ntrackers in a society so concerned with fitness and body\nimage.",
        "According to one report [15], one in ten Americans\nover the age of 18 owns an activity tracker.",
        "However, of the\npeople who do purchase activity trackers, many fail to use\nthe devices long term.",
        "More than half of people who own\nactivity trackers no longer use them, and a third of people\nwho own trackers stop using them within six months [15].",
        "This raises several questions.",
        "Who benefit from these\ndevices?",
        "Why are people not using them?",
        "Particularly, what\nare the reasons people abandon them?",
        "To explore these questions, a group of users were asked to\npurchase smart devices, sensors, and wearables to advance\nthemselves towards a _ personal,  self-defined goal.",
        "Participants were interviewed about their use after two\nmonths.",
        "In this paper, we explore the above questions and expand\non previous literature that discuss the motivations of smart\ndevice users and the barriers that they experience.",
        "We\nsuggest ways to design smart devices to reduce barriers and\nto increase motivation to use smart devices."

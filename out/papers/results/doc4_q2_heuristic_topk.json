        "We propose ways to reduce\nbarriers, motivate use, and argue for envisioning an\nadditional function of these devices for short-term\ninterventions, in addition to standard long-term use.",
        "In another study by\nLi et al., participants who had been self-tracking for at least\none month were interviewed about the questions they had\nabout the data they collected [12].",
        "Even when the participants had learned\nsomething useful or made a behavior change, participants\ninternalized abandonment of devices as failure.",
        "Approximately two months later,\nparticipants were interviewed to discuss the devices\npurchased and the reasoning behind the purchases.",
        "Once the coding\nscheme was finalized, all interview data was then coded and\nshared with the research team.",
        "Sensors were abandoned for a variety of reasons, primarily\nin three categories: devices not fitting with participants’\nconceptions of themselves, collected data not being useful,\nand devices requiring too much work and maintenance.",
        "We\nsuggest ways to design smart devices to reduce barriers and\nto increase motivation to use smart devices.",
        "We propose\nembracing a short-term intervention mentality to broaden\nthe market for these devices, while supporting designs\nbetter suited to the lived practices of the everyday user.",
        "feelings), social interaction (e.g.",
        "We contend that the collected data\nrepresents an important first look at some of these identified\nbehaviors and attitudes.",
        "Curiosity was often sated after participants discovered some\nquantified number about their activities.",
        "It is important for researchers to explore the\nexperience of participants with other backgrounds and work\nexperience.",
        "First, through their work and network, they were\nmore likely to be aware of different devices and therefore\nlikely selected a wider variety of devices than from a group\nunfamiliar with the landscape of smart devices.",
        "What kinds of devices were used?",
        "At the start of the study,\nparticipants were surveyed to find what goals, objectives,\nand passions they were interested in addressing with smart\ndevices.",
        "Despite the benefits of long-term use of devices, our\nanalysis leads us to believe that there is an under-explored\nclass of smart devices, particularly for wearables: those that\nmight be beneficial for short-term interventions.",
        "Participants abandoned almost 80% of devices purchased\nfor this study within the first two months (see Table 2).",
        "This\nhappened when participants could not meet device goals\nbecause of environmental factors, such as P1 (trying to\nreduce neck pain) who said, “I would take [the] LumoBack\n[posture sensor] off when I go home because at that point\nI'm with my daughter...",
        "Another participant used the Phyode W/me, a heart rate\nsensor with a breathing app, to increase mindfulness during\nthe day.",
        "ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank those who participated in this study.",
        "Increasing Motivation for Users\n\nHowever, even if all barriers were lowered, people like\nsome of the participants in this study might still not engage\nin long-term use of devices for a variety of reasons.",
        "Some participants grew tired of bringing tablets\naround with them as their phones were not compatible with\ndevices.",
        "I've\ngot a mental map.” Like P13, others lost interest in using\ndevices once they developed a sense of what data would be\ngenerated when they engaged in various activities.",
        "The reader\nshould therefore not assume that the users fully adopted the\nten devices that were being used at the exit interview.",
        "Given that participants could choose any goal, it is\ninteresting that the majority chose health and fitness, which\nmay be the result of the current marketing of commercially\navailable smart devices.",
        "Finally, not surprisingly, some participants, especially the\nengineers, expressed very technology-positive views.",
        "Though these probabilities may still\nbe considered too vague for some users, they can be more\nconcrete than they are currently.",
        "Reconceptualizing Abandonment as Short Term Use\nThe recommendations above are particularly pertinent to\nencourage long-term use of devices (though we believe they\nare good practice in general).",
        "Unlinking\nabandonment of devices with failure raises bigger questions\nabout the intended future of these devices: is the goal to\ncreate smart sensing systems that are continuously relevant\nand useful to a user or is the goal to create a device that\nsupports a user’s need even if that need is temporary?",
        "Out of\nthirteen smart watches used over the course of the study and\nthe six posture detectors, only one of smart watch and one\nposture detector was being used at the end of the study.",
        "To explore these questions, a group of users were asked to\npurchase smart devices, sensors, and wearables to advance\nthemselves towards a _ personal,  self-defined goal.",
        "This hope for potential use kept some participants using and\nincreased the frequency with which they used devices after\nthey had lost interest in the novelty of the data, even when\ndata was not useful to them.",
        "Because the potential benefit came from data,\ndevices that did not store data were less desired.",
        "First,\ngiving participants funds to purchase devices may have\naffected their choices and use of devices.",
        "Given the promises made by the producers of these devices,\none might expect the widespread adoption of activity\ntrackers in a society so concerned with fitness and body\nimage.",
        "This approach also resulted in\nsimilar findings across different types of devices (such as\nissues with charging), which strengthens their significance\nand likelihood to apply to other similar devices.",
        "Participants were free to choose whichever devices they\nwished to purchase and were reimbursed.",
        "This expectation for future\nbenefit led participants to stop using devices that did not\nstore data.",
        "While the responses that we observed do not\nconstitute a ground truth, however, they are both “real” and\n“useful” in that they represent a diverse sampling of\nwearable device usage that has been driven by the\npreferences of the subjects, rather than a _ top-down,\nexperimental structure.",
        "[5], [16]).",
        "Additionally, seven participants had used smart devices\npreviously, though not for an extended amount of time.",
        "Detailed notes from interviews and transcripts were\nanalyzed using open and axial coding by two of the\nresearchers to identify emergent themes.",
        "Hope for potential use\n\nAnother factor that kept participants using devices was\nhope that the current capabilities of devices would be\nextended someday with new ways to process recorded data.",
        "It seems clear that these\ndevices need to be designed to avoid this pitfall.",
        "This reasoning follows the line of thought that more\n\nPermission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for\npersonal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are\nnot made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies\nbear this notice and the full citation on the first page.",
        "Their\nfamiliarity with technology was beneficial for multiple\nreasons.",
        "INTRODUCTION\n\nSmart devices promise users a wealth of information that\nwill enable them to become the best versions of themselves.",
        "Of\nthe 49 devices used, 35 were purchased with study funds\nand 14 were obtained some other way during the study\nperiod or before the study had started (purchased with\npersonal funds, purchased with work funds for a different\nproject, found, or borrowed from a participant who had\npurchased the device).",
        "Another element considered\nuncomfortable was when devices had to be worn tight\naround the body to function properly (such as the\nLumoBack, Hexoskin, and heart rate monitors).",
        "These numbers suggest that participants were more likely to\ncontinue to use activity trackers, particularly unobtrusive\nones, than smart watches (many of which had similar\nfunctions as activity trackers, such as counting steps)."

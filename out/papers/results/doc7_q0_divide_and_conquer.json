        "We then present the three studies we conducted:\nStudy 1: requirements gathering interviews with all\nstakeholders; Study 2: interviews whilst stakeholders\ninteracted with the proposed app prototype; and Study 3:\n\nPage 1\n\n\nCHI 2019 Paper\n\nevaluating the app’s usability and the user experience (UX)\nduring a short exploratory field study with end-users.",
        "Although they evaluated the apps with\n\nPaper 703\n\nCHI 2019, May 4-9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK\n\nend-users, they did not involve them in the design.",
        "Page 2\n\n\nCHI 2019 Paper\n\nProgress: Low adherence to treatment is an issue not only\nrelated to OAB, as other research investigating knee [2],\nfalls [58] and stroke rehabilitation [38] provided similar\nfindings.",
        "Location: People with OAB tend to perform their activities\nclose to toilet locations to avoid leakages and embarrassing\n\nPaper 703\n\nCHI 2019, May 4-9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK\n\nsituations [32].",
        "The only contradiction\nfound was regarding the toilet mapping concept, where\nboth nurses disagreed with the medical consultants and\nquestioned the usefulness of the concept: “It should be used\n\nPage 3\n\n\nCHI 2019 Paper\n\nas a backup plan and not to ease their access to toilets.",
        "We also wanted to make\nsure that the interview structure did not cause any\n\nPaper 703\n\nCHI 2019, May 4-9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK\n\nemotional distress.",
        "As a goal,\n\nPage 4\n\n\nCHI 2019 Paper\n\nUPs would mostly want to reduce their number of voids\n(6/9) and leakages (3/9).",
        "In addition to\nfluid intake reminders, we also wanted to understand UPs’\n\nPaper 703\n\nCHI 2019, May 4-9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK\n\nview regarding the PFM reminder icon.",
        "Finally, as UPs also suggested\ndistractions that do not require any interaction and the fact\nthat they wouldn’t be able to play games all the time at\n\nPage 5\n\n\nCHI 2019 Paper\n\nwork, we implemented the concept of doing quick PFM\ncontractions as a distraction.",

        "Whilst two nurses emphasized\nthe fact that precise urine quantities are needed otherwise\nthe diary would be meaningless, MP2 agreed with using\n\nAnother contradiction found was\n\nPage 6\n\n\nCHI 2019 Paper\n\napproximations as “Measuring urine is not easy and this\nwould increase compliance.”.",

        "We\nprovided UPs with tasks and NASA-TLX questionnaire as\nwe wanted to evaluate the app and the mental load of the\n\nPaper 703\n\nCHI 2019, May 4-9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK\n\ngames (since we were using them as a suppression\ntechnique).",

        "Distractions: All UPs agree or strongly agree when asked\nif they are satisfied with the games: “Now I found I can\n\nPage 9\n\n\nCHI 2019 Paper\n\ndistract myself-not totally, but I can take my mind out of the\nurge and go continue with other things.” (UP18).",
        "One reason\nfor this might be the fact that UPs used the app for a short\n\nPaper 703\n\nCHI 2019, May 4-9, 2019, Glasgow, Scotland, UK\n\nperiod of time in known locations and did not find\nthemselves in a situation where they needed to use the\nmap.",
